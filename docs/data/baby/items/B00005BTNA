Its patented anti-leak bottom vent prevents air from mixing with liquid, helping to keep air out of the contents and allow your baby feed more comfortably. Clinically proven to reduce gas, colic, and messy spit-ups, the angled bottle promotes the semi-upright feeding position recommended by pediatricians to help prevent ear infections. BPA- and Phthalate-free, the 9-ounce bottle ensures that babies feed safely every time.Please note: the image above represents the Playtex VentAire family of products and not the product being sold here.View larger.See What's in the Box for details.Playtex VentAire products help protect against gas, colic, and spit-ups.View larger.The Playtex VentAire Family: Pediatrician Recommended for Easy, Safe FeedingPlaytex designs their VentAire bottles and nipples to promote the semi-upright feeding position pediatricians recommend to prevent ear infections. Micro-channel vents create a consistent flow of liquid, minimizing pressure on your baby's ear canals and protecting against gas, colic, and spit-ups.Well-Designed Bottle for Proper Feeding TechniqueEach angled VentAire bottle helps promote the proper, semi-upright feeding position that is recommended by pediatricians to avoid ear infections. The slender bottles allow a sure grip for even the tiniest hands and caregivers can comfortably hold the bottle while feeding.Patented Venting System to Reduce GasMicro-channel vents placed on the bottom of the bottle, instead of slits on the nipple, provide a consistent flow of liquid. Air enters and exits the bottle without mixing with the milk, greatly reducing gas, colic, and messy spit-ups, while also minimizing pressure on your baby's ear canals. The BPA- and Phthalate-free bottle comes in a variety of sizes so your baby can grow with the VentAire system.Easy Cleanup and Convenient, Pre-Calibrated BottlesFor added convenience, the VentAire bottles open at both ends for easy cleaning. The bottles, bottle caps, vent disks, and nipples are safe to wash on the top rack of the dishwasher or can be rinsed with hot, soapy water.
