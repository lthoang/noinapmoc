BPA-free and dishwasher-safe, the Feeding Set provides a fun and safe way for little ones to take mealtimes into their own hands.Four-Piece Feeding Set(Green)At a Glance:Ages: 12 months +The Feeding Set provides a fun and safe way for little ones to take mealtimes into their own hands.View larger.Plate and Bowl Accommodate Growing ToddlersDesigned for children 12 months and older, the OXO Tot Four-Piece Feeding Set will see your toddler through the various stages of development. The plate features a curved ring that helps little ones guide food onto their utensils and helps keep food where it belongs--on the plate and not on your floor. And because the ring can be removed when your tot has mastered the art of self-feeding, the plate can be used as your child grows.The 12-ounce bowl features high walls to make scooping up pudding or yogurt onto utensils easy. Additionally, both the bright green bowl and plate have non-slip bases to prevent accidental tips and spills.Fork and Spoon Capture Food Easily, Safely, and EffectivelyThe fork tines pierce food effectively--without sharp edges--so toddlers can capture slippery food without accidentally hurting themselves. And to make self-feeding as easy as possible, the spoon has a deep head for effortless scooping.Made of stainless steel, each sturdy utensil features soft, green, non-slip handles designed for little hands to hold and use comfortably. The handles are lightly curved to prevent the utensils from sliding into a bowl or plate.Safe and ConvenientThe Four-Piece Feeding Set is BPA-, phthalate-, and PVC-free, so you'll have one less thing to worry about at mealtime. And the set is dishwasher safe for added convenience.The OXO Tot Feeding Line: The Right Tools for the JobIn five years, 25 babies were born to OXO employees, making for many users of all things baby!
