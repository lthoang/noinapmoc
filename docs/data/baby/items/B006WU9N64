{"asin": "B006WU9N64", "categories": [["Baby"]], "description": "Finally, an all in one reusable diaper that truly challenges the convenience and trim-fit of a disposable diaper.&#xA0; Thirsties Duo AIO offers absorbency, waterproof protection, and adjustability all rolled up into one stylish, comfortable and extremely effective cloth diaper. The unique design of Thirsties Duo AIO offers a trim-fitting, easy to use, customizable diaper that also cleans up like a dream.  This incredible diaper includes Thirsties&#x2019; signature tunnel system which enables stuffing of additional absorbency when needed. A built-in three-layer microfiber terry soaker absorbs an amazing seven times its weight in liquid. The soaker is topped with our stay-dry microfleece which keeps your baby feeling dry. All in all, Thirsties Duo AIO gets a BIG thumbs-up from your wallet, your family, your daycare facility, and your occasional caretakers alike.  Both hook & loop and snap closures are available on Thirsties Duo line. While many families prefer hook & loop closures because of the simple, secure fit they provide, snap closures do have a few advantages of their own. They are pretty much indestructible and are more unyielding than our hook & loop closures, making them more challenging to unfasten for a toddler who prefers to go naked. The mission of Thirsties, Inc. is to make it easy and affordable for every family to choose cloth while simultaneously investing in our local economy and sustainable business practices. We are very proud of the fact that all Thirsties products are manufactured in Colorado, USA, by a group of very talented individuals, many of whom are moms who work in the comfort and convenience of their own homes. We delight in the opportunity to sell products that contribute to a happy and healthy start for your children while helping to minimize your baby&#x2019;s first carbon footprints.
