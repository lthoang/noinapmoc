For 11 years, the firm fabricated machine and car parts for local manufacturers. In 1953, Gray left the firm, leaving Cone as sole owner. Cone decided to manufacture his own line of products, but had trouble coming up with ideas. Enter David Saint, an engineer, tinkerer, and stained glass artisan who worked for Graco. Saint, himself a father of nine, was intrigued when an associate told him how his wife would soothe their tired and cranky baby while swinging in a backyard glider swing. Acting on this inspiration, he went to the drawing board and 18 months of hard work later, the world's first wind-up infant swing, the Graco Swyngomatic, was born. Graco sold millions of Swyngomatics in the coming years, becoming one of the world's leading manufacturers of juvenile products in the process. Today, Graco is a Newell Rubbermaid company, with 1500 associates worldwide. While a half-century has brought many changes to Graco, their dedication and commitment to designing and manufacturing top-quality products remains, and continues on.What's in the BoxGraco SnugRider Infant Car Seat Stroller Frame.", "title": "Graco SnugRider Infant Car Seat Stroller Frame", "price": 119.89, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ESx9oT1fL._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0047GNVR2", "B0012W02OE", "B00007DWBH", "B004Q8FFTS", "B009EDSWJA", "B004FN11KQ", "B004Q8JH0G", "B008C0R684", "B0042D69WY", "B00295MQLU", "B002NGMXTU", "B007KXO970", "B0045I6IA4", "B005IWM73S", "B004PXCGWI", "B005TI82DK", "B004Q8FG0G", "B000M4K4BY", "B004C43JHG", "B005MI648C", "B002TLU5JO", "B005TI81CM", "B000OY539A", "B000B1N8QG", "B004323NHS", "B004Q8HEF6", "B004PX7AIS", "B000K53UEI", "B002UD65XQ", "B0002AHVZU", "B0040Z3YD6", "B00171WXII", "B001EPQ1QW", "B0013FGWD0", "B001BMWABI", "B004J7ZLZO", "B000IDSLOG", "B00313J7WK", "B003KN27C8", "B004L2JJAK", "B004DFO57M", "B002UD65ZE", "B004HWXCJS", "B000067K0L", "B002R59KBQ", "B002L7Y5RY", "B0009JB3A8", "B001KZH692", "B005TI802S", "B002V92XAS", "B002V92XB2", "B001PGKPNK", "B001IXYOD2", "B0019QB1P2", "B005ASKQ42", "B001O9F6M8", "B003A5MUD2", "B004GJXMAQ", "B000G7TIZA", "B0000BX8MT", "B0038JDVCE", "B000096QQ5", "B001V9EVCM", "B002MN3JY2", "B004Q8EYF4", "B004Q8LL9Q", "B0033B9CZ2", "B000TJQMAO", "B000LXQVA4", "B002OU8JAC", "B000UYFULU", "B0007CQ726", "B004Q8HDZC", "B00A4B34IA", "B000O7SR18", "B006ZVV0NO", "B00092A7E8", "1889392413", "B002J4U8M0", "B0037W6NZO", "B003JHYDIQ", "B005Q3LSDO", "B000MUBWTG", "B0018JWAF0"], "also_viewed": ["B008OIPZW8", "B007J6TMYI", "B00838BNK2", "B004LVOVSQ", "B000BMKEVC", "B00009VE5O", "B003AXZQBC", "B00B07STAK", "B003JHRJOG", "B001PQO5RC", "B00A72MXLU", "B005JDOYF0", "B000WJPCMK", "B00CHN6WJ6", "B002WWF4IM", "B008P8EZOG", "B003HEX4Q8", "B004RKIW4A", "B00AHVR1QI", "B000HZEQSU", "B008H7S898", "B000MUBWTG", "B0023RSZL4", "B002PXBDMY", "B00005V6C8", "B004EWGDD8", "B00AHVR3GQ", "B0012W02OE", "B001N4LE5M", "B001AV40Z4", "B00H8MQ5IE", "B00BR0ON8M", "B005FLMV2E", "0811868117", "B00AHVR3G6", "B00AHPZZGC", "B00171WXII", "B008U4MKU6", "B007VBYVWE", "B0047GNVR2", "B00ASI748K", "1558327207", "B003OH0W90", "B00CRATWXM", "B008KCR7U6", "B00LFI3BUC", "B00007DWBH"], "bought_together": ["B0047GNVR2"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B008OIPZW8", "B00BNQEZXS", "B00AHVR1QI", "B00A72MXLU"]}, "categories": [["Baby"]]}
