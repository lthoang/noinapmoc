It stands on a base, with the infant bucket seat attached to two arches by adjustable, spring-loaded straps. When baby is placed in the seat, he can kick off the ground with his legs to bounce up and down. This provides vital exercise for a youngster's legs, helping to prepare him for walking. The six-point height adjustment lets it grow with your infant, while non-skid feet and fabric-covered springs keep baby safe.Most bouncers stop there -- but we're delighted to find that the Activity Jumper also surrounds baby with plenty of fun, interactive toys. The bucket seat can rotate 360 degrees for baby to reach all of the activities. He'll delight in the frog spinner, bead chaser, and baby-proof mirror. The toy also includes 10 Baby Einstein links that can be repositioned and detached from the activity center for on-the-go play, or which serve as attachment points for additional toys.A teether stalk toy helps soothe itchy gums while encouraging \"reach and grab\" coordination. And the light-up piano keys give baby an interactive introduction to musical creativity with two modes: the \"piano notes\" mode plays in piano tones, while the \"melodies\" mode features five classical melodies.Help Your Little One Get StrongerBabies love bouncing. Not only is it exciting for a baby to move himself with the power of his own legs, but it gives him satisfying, and vital, exercise that helps prepare him for standing and walking. The higher and harder that baby bounces in the Activity Jumper, the more the toys will rattle and shake -- making it even more exciting and fun. And with the added benefit of a rotating seat, which baby operates by pushing off the ground with his feet, your infant gets even more leg coordination practice in a safe, secure place. We especially enjoy the versatility of this 2-for-1 toy -- and it's safer than an infant walker.Other perks for parents: the fabric seat cover is a cinch to remove, and it's machine washable. And unlike some other bouncers, the Activity Jumper folds down flat for much easier storage. While it's erected, however, it takes up a bit of room. And because your baby won't be able to use this toy once he's able to stand and walk unassisted, it has a limited-use timeframe.What's in the BoxActivity jumper, assembly hardware, quick start guide, and user's guide.", "title": "Baby Einstein Musical Motion Activity Jumper, Green", "price": 117.79, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51wPZm-nEkL._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B003LQQGE4", "B000LXQVA4", "B0042D69V0", "B00DW3Y1JI", "B00EUV2BSE", "B000WUD83O", "B003LQVZQ8", "B00BUO461E", "B0080D5982", "B00AJSJE6O", "B000WJLKQM", "B006CFBJ20", "B007IUYMUE", "B001H0GF10", "B00AJSJCC0", "B007IV17PQ"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B003LQQGE4", "B000LXQVA4", "B000YDDF6O", "B0042D69V0"]}, "categories": [["Baby"]]}
