This is why Freddie strikes a balance between bright, high contrast patterns that help stimulate baby's vision, and bold solid colors that give baby's eyes a place to rest. Sounds like squeak, clink, and crinkle also help stimulate and develop baby's auditory skills. Finally, Freddie's large, friendly eyes invite baby to focus and stare at a single object, which can help calm baby while supporting healthy eye development.Child-Safe DesignMade to be safe for newborns and young children, Freddie features a soft velour body that's ideal for cuddling and busy wings with a peek-a-boo mirror for interactive play. Multiple textures keep your baby interested, encouraging her to explore. Additionally, the rings clink together, and the tethered ladybug teether--which baby can pull out or store in a cute little pocket--and knotted antennae are perfect for chewing. For added fun and to aid small motor development, there's also a ball that squeaks when squeezed.Freddie comes with a 90-day limited warranty.KnottiesClick clack ringsCrinkle wingsSqueakerMirrorPull out teetherHigh Contrast Black and White patternsAbout TomyThe creative force behind hundreds of award-winning toys, Tomy created the Lamaze Infant Development System by working in tandem with parents, babies, and childhood experts.
