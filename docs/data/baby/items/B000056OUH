{"asin": "B000056OUH", "categories": [["Baby"]], "description": "Sterilize six baby bottles in just two minutes: imagine what our grandparents would say! The Avent Express II Microwave Sterilizer is a modern-day technological wonder&hellip;and a joy for most parents, who will do anything for a little peace of mind and a few extra minutes to spare. Using a regular kitchen microwave, this lightweight sterilizer eliminates household bacteria and keeps contents sterile for up to 24 hours. It can be used to sterilize Avent feeding bottles of varying sizes (and their nipples, rings, and dome caps), Avent Isis breast pump accessories, Via cups and lids, Via Disposable Nursers, and other non-electrical Avent products. Its compact size and ease of use make the sterilizer perfect for traveling, too.Protect Your Baby from BacteriaThe Avent Express II Microwave Sterilizer effectively and quickly kills the kind of household bacteria that can wreak havoc on babies&rsquo; delicate new systems. Establishing a routine of washing bottles and pump supplies in gentle, soapy water, then sterilizing them, will ensure that baby will have a clean start in life.No More Pots and Pans and Boiling WaterThe Avent Express is simplicity itself once you get the hang of it. After reading the detailed instructions with great care (assembly and loading are not completely intuitive, and there are important details that can make all the difference in safety and effectiveness of the sterilizer), pour the correct amount of water into the base. Load the pre-washed bottles and feeding components into the appropriate spots in the plastic rack, position the lid over the sterilizer base and lock the clips into place. (You&rsquo;ll hear a click.) Place the sterilizer in the center of the microwave, and select microwave wattage and timings (a chart is included to determine proper wattage and time). Allow the unit to cool for at least two minutes before removing the sterilizer from the microwave. Use the safety grips on the base&mdash;they stay cooler to ensure safer handling. If you don&rsquo;t remove the lid, the contents will stay sterile for up to 24 hours.Care and CleaningThe all-plastic sterilizer is dishwasher safe. Always drain the excess water from the unit and rinse to prevent the build-up of limescale. Always store when the unit is completely dry.What&rsquo;s in the BoxThe Avent Express II Microwave Sterilizer consists of a sturdy plastic base (11 inches in diameter) with safety grips; a bottle/accessory rack with dome cap stem, bottle cavity, nipple cavity, and Isis Breast Pump slots; and a lid with locking clips. It can be used with most standard microwaves with wattage range from 500 to 1,850 watts. The box also contains a detailed and illustrated instruction manual.Note: When taking the sterilizer out of the microwave, use great caution! It will still be hot, as will be the contents. When removing the lid, point it away from you to allow the steam to escape. Follow loading, assembling, and care instructions meticulously.--Emilie Coulter", "title": "Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer", "price": 50.32, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41TpRramnlL._SY300_.jpg", "brand": "Philips Avent", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000K53UEI", "B004HFQOLI", "B001C3I1AA", "B0009ET49K", "B00GULB24G", "B007HKOL92", "B00295MQLU", "B005MI648C", "B005TI81CM", "B007VBXJ7M", "B007VBXJ6S", "B00IA0SK6S", "B005G3QSF2", "B004Q8FFTS", "B005TI82DK", "B000RFCXIK", "B000LSL5ZK", "B00DB5F114", "B000LZFZVS", "B0038JDVCE", "B009EDSWJA", "B0045I6IA4", "B001GQ2SA2", "B004DFO57M", "B000N351WQ", "B001L2SA6M", "B001O9F6M8", "B000BNCA4K", "B000FI3QSK", "B000096QQ5", "B000IDSLOG", "B000056W6I", "B006L1O8EQ", "B00198PQHY", "B00433OQO6", "B007N95L6O", "B00494DNZC", "B002TLU5JO", "B004323NHS", "B0009JB3A8", "B0007CQ726", "B001V9EVCM", "B006SQDSZ4", "B004HFQON6", "B000CNOIQ2", "B008B5MMNO", "B002WUZJ2A", "B0018JWAF0", "B00005BXKM", "B002L3T9YM", "B00CQHYX08", "B002USE0Q0", "B002UD65XQ", "B0019QB1P2", "B000067EH7", "B007KXO970", "B004044LD4", "B004QZBEFK", "B001UF8BL4", "B00171WXII", "B006Z6E8AG", "B000YDDF6O", "B001IXYOD2", "B0052QYLUM", "B00643FQVA", "B009TJ3J60", "B000W3XEQM", "B004Q8JH0G", "B0042D69WY"], "also_viewed": ["B007VBXKG2", "B004HFQOM2", "B0057ECYS0", "B001C3KXPG", "B001G2K2BS", "B000V9DXGS", "B001KY4CRW", "B004J4VY44", "B00E1CI2W6", "B001D475FU", "B002DWFOBS", "B007INU6EC", "B00A5LI8Q2", "B00006AN4P", "B00FZGLO1S", "B004HK3WOU", "B001C3I1AA", "B0000AY9XY", "B0049JLNWW", "B002WN2B6O", "B004HFQOLI", "B005AYC45A", "B00LBFSU1Y", "B00E1CI2TO", "B0013T1J1G", "B001CWEYFC", "B00BBSP1L8", "B000K53UEI", "B00AKIQPEW", "B008EYOGL8", "B000096QQ5", "B00CXVKYD2", "B005DNB2F6", "B002LTT65I", "B003069Z9S", "B005IDMZY8", "B00433OQO6", "B00GULB27I", "B0009ET49K", "B00ETPI5YA", "B00IKJ0PK8", "B0035LQNNE", "B00BZAOLBI", "B000056OUF", "B000056JND", "B00GULB24G", "B007FF427K", "B00005BXKM", "B003P9WSVC", "B000056HMB", "B008TACLZK", "B0035LLG2W", "B007VBXJ7M", "B0006BAJIG", "B00CXVJWKI"], "bought_together": ["B000K53UEI"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B007VBXKG2", "B004HFQOM2", "B0057ECYS0", "B000K53UEI"]}}
