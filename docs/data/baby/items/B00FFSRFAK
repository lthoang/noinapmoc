{"asin": "B00FFSRFAK", "categories": [["Baby"]], "description": "Similar in feel and function to our best-selling Diaper Cover, Thirsties Duo Wraps are completely waterproof yet remain breathable, pliable, and very comfortable for your baby's delicate skin. &#xA0;With the adjustable rise you will only need two sizes from birth to potty. Leg gussets provide advanced leak-proof protection and bindings are super-soft against your baby&#x2019;s skin. Pairing the adjustability in rise with our signature leg gussets, makes this wrap the most versatile on the market. Whether your baby is tall or short, thin or chunky, this cover will keep those messes contained!  Thirsties Duo Wraps are a very trim fitting cover. They are the preferred wrap for trifolded prefolds or trim fit diapers, such as our Duo Fab Fitted diaper. For bulkier systems and/or for nighttime double stuffing, we recommend Thirsties Diaper Cover, which has a roomier fit. The inside of Duo Wraps can be wiped clean between uses allowing for fewer wraps in rotation and greater affordability.   We recommend one cover for every 3-4 diapers in rotation (excluding diapers with waterproof exteriors). Both hook & loop and snap closures are available on Thirsties Duo Wrap. While many families prefer hook & loop closures because of the simple, secure fit they provide, snap closures do have a few advantages of their own. They are pretty much indestructible and are more unyielding than our hook-and-loop closures, making them more challenging to unfasten for a toddler who prefers to go naked. The mission of Thirsties, Inc. is to make it easy and affordable for every family to choose cloth while simultaneously investing in our local economy and sustainable business practices. We are very proud of the fact that all Thirsties products are manufactured in Colorado, USA, by a group of very talented individuals, many of whom are moms who work in the comfort and convenience of their own homes. We delight in the opportunity to sell products that contribute to a happy and healthy start for your children while helping to minimize your baby&#x2019;s first carbon footprints.
