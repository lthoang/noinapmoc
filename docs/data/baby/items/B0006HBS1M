First, the contoured, ergonomically designed handle fits easily in your hand. The handle also swivels, giving you the freedom to position your hand and then pump more comfortably on each breast.Two-Phase Expression TechnologyDesigned to feel more like your baby than any other manual pump, the Harmony features two-phase expression technology, an advanced pumping pattern that mimics a baby's natural nursing rhythm.This system works in two modes: the simulation mode and the expression mode. The simulation mode simulates your baby's initial rapid sucking to start your milk flowing, while the expression mode simulates your baby's slower, deeper suckling to express your milk gently yet efficiently. These modes work together to make pumping a quick and painless process.Convenient, Safe and User-Friendly DesignMedela knows that busy moms don't have the time or patience to struggle with complicated parts or to wait for the pump to stimulate milk flow. That's why the Harmony is designed for faster let-down.Additionally, this one-piece unit features fewer pieces to assemble and clean than traditional manual pumps, making it a snap to start pumping when and where you need to. Most importantly, the Harmony is a safe and sanitary way to provide your baby with healthy breast milk--all parts that come into contact with breast milk are 100-percent BPA/DEHP free. For added convenience, this pump is also upgradeable to electric pumping with the use of the Symphony or the Lactina conversion kits (not included), and it is backed with a 30-day limited warranty.About MedelaFounded in 1961 in Zug, Switzerland by Olle Larsson, Medela is committed to supporting the WHO Code's depiction of breastfeeding and breast milk as the optimal nutrition for the growth, development and health of babies.
