There is no other carrier available like it (a ready-to-wear wrap!) that enables parents & caregivers to comfortably carry infants and toddlers (from birth to 3 years) in multiple positions. The K'tan carrier is ideal for premature babies and babies with special needs. It is lightweight and compact like a sling, yet goes over both shoulders to evenly distribute baby's weight like a structured carrier. The adjustable back support band offers the wearer extra back support and makes it easy to adjust baby or toddler's weight distribution on both shoulders. The exclusive design offers the wearer a 100% natural cotton carrier that is ready-to-wear, with NO buckles, snaps, rings or hardware! Extremely simple to use, the secret behind this parent-invented, ready-to-wear baby carrier is its unique double-loop design, which gives added security for carrying baby and privacy for mom while nursing! It is easy to put on and take off, and comes in a free carry bag!
