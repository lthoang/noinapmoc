Two soft leaves extend from the frame to create an overhead canopy with soft toys that dangle down for fun bat-at play. It also features a rotating seat with soft spring covers that keep little fingers safe from pinching, and three-position height adjustment for a custom fit.Stimulating Interactive PlayEverything your baby needs at play-time can be found in this Rainforest Jumperoo. Its newly designed frame both allows you to open it up from the top, and lets the seat rotate 360 degrees so baby can play and interact from any side. A fun seat and toys at five locations on the platform engage baby all the way around, and an electronic toy at the front has motion, music and lights that can be activated by baby spinning a drum. (Mom or Dad can also activate an option for four minutes of continuous play.)Little explorers will also enjoy playing with the Jumperoo's many animals and toys, including a bobbling elephant, a monkey swinging from a vine, a parrot hanging from a bead bar, a clear spinning bead ball, a tiger that plays hide and seek, a spinning lizard that makes rattling sounds, a tethered chew toy, and a stack of chips with eye-catching graphics for baby to explore.Encourages Healthy DevelopmentThe Rainforest Jumperoo is designed to help encourage healthy development. Moving, spinning, and jumping in a baby jumper enhances large motor skills. Secondly, the variety of textures integrated into the rainforest toys provide tactile stimulation, while the bright colors and fun music engage your child's visual and auditory senses. This educational system also enhances learning through discovery; baby's actions make things happen, helping him to understand cause and effect. Finally, reaching and grasping onto the baby jumper's toys fosters eye-hand coordination.Easy to Use, Move, and StoreParents will appreciate the quick take-down and portability of the Rainforest Jumperoo--the frame pivots to a nested position so it can be tucked away when not in use, and it simply folds so you can carry it from room to room. And no doorway is required to use this toy, making it a breeze to set it up anywhere.The Rainforest Jumperoo includes a motion sensor that encourages kids by rewarding them with lights and sounds when they jump, has a weight capacity of 25 pounds and maximum height 32 inches, and requires three \"AA\" batteries (not included). It also measures 32.0 x 43.125 x 37 inches (WxHxD).", "title": "Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo", "price": 73.32, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51RHuKEyzVL._SY300_.jpg", "brand": "Fisher-Price", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000BNCA4K", "B001NJC5QY", "B000S9RF4M", "B000YDDF6O", "B00DFFT8JQ", "B0019QCGVK", "B005OI8O88", "B0058K5IIQ", "B001UF8BL4", "B0043D28B4", "B00DJBU7FU", "B00913DY3W", "B00DFFT76U", "B00F2MQ294", "B000I2Q0F4", "B003N9M6YI", "B000IDSLOG", "B000WJLKQM", "B00CQHYX08", "B005DLCJX2", "B000CSBP3G", "B0038JDUYI", "B005IWM99K", "B006Z6E8AG", "B004X0WBHS", "B0013FGWD0", "B0053X62GK", "B00EIGLDN0", "B000LSL5ZK", "B00DFFT6YS", "B004G8QSYO", "B003KMWATY", "B0089W1IGG", "B004QZBEFK", "B007CUBCGW", "B00FBEO588", "B0018JWAF0", "B005KWL0OI", "B000ICZ9Y2", "B0092NNQ98", "B000NAOH1A", "B005XJ2VGE", "B00B9ZRZFS", "B001ABZGU2", "B00H4E9WLI", "0743289579", "B00CWN3FNM", "B0045JKUU2", "B009TJ3J60", "B00D2WUR8I", "B005ZBHYI0", "B002QYW8LW", "B006YBHE6M", "1440528993", "B000056C86", "B000FFL58Q", "B00CQHZ0ZK", "B000XPWXK2", "B00H57F2B8", "B003KMW4EA", "B0055DXEGY", "B00HAZSC3K", "B005KWLEVW", "B00D40VM8M", "B000I2WB6G", "B005E7K3LU", "B00B63M9VS", "B002TLU5JO", "B0080D5982", "B005IWM8PU", "B00IZUJGTS", "B004HM368U", "B004TEVU52", "B00DFFT5IU", "B002J4U8M0", "B00B1M2TUK", "B00AGMBOXY", "B00DFFT9S6", "B0031B5CEE", "B00I5R5XTI", "B009ICN71K", "B004PYD2OI", "B00DFFT77E", "B001EQTMDK", "B00F2MQ258", "B000GK5XY2", "B00ARPETGE", "B008J1QP7Y", "B000N0SNHY", "B002UD65XQ", "B000I2Q0C2", "B0034G61DC", "B00A4B34IA", "B00A6Y02QC", "B007HKOL92", "B00009IMCK", "B006I0R7Q6", "B002U2GDLQ", "B004A9ZF3Y", "B0055QVU6M"], "also_viewed": ["B0042D69V0", "B00EUV2BSE", "B000WUD83O", "B0080D5982", "B00AJSJCC0", "B00BUO461E", "B007IV17PQ", "B003LQQGE4", "B00DW3Y1JI", "B00GRS9XEI", "B00AJSJE6O", "B002OOWADK", "B00CXVOGX6", "B007IUYMUE", "B00F2MQ2BW", "B006QI1PCW", "B000WJLKQM", "B00EIGLTQ6", "B002VUCBC2", "B002VBXY40", "B006PB2H2C", "B0046N26YU", "B000FFL58Q", "B000I2WB6G", "B00A49ZKN4", "B00CWN3FNW", "B0016ZWI6C", "B00AJSJC9S", "B00A4B34IA", "B00FNJ7D58", "B00F2MQ294", "B005IWM9OU", "B00ENVHR7Q", "B000JPYEJY", "B0042D69WY", "B0062TNCNA", "B001H0GF10", "B00AJSJCAW", "B000S9RF4M", "B001H0GGUU", "B00E9VQ8EI", "B00CWN3FNM", "B00GUN3Z6C", "B003LQVZQ8", "B0042RU2SW", "B00FNJ7FR4", "B0045JKUU2", "B00E9VRXVU", "B00DWBQI82", "B00JU949AE", "B00AY20D60", "B005C1APXO", "B005P5DBCY", "B004FC6EEU", "B00E9VOKZW", "B00477ND0Q"], "bought_together": ["B000YDDF6O", "B000BNCA4K"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0042D69V0", "B00EUV2BSE", "B000WUD83O", "B00AJSJCC0"]}}
