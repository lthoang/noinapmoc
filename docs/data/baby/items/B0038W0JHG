Offering True Side Impact Protection, this seat delivers superior protection if you happen to face an unexpected side-impact accident.If such an event takes place, the solid head support and deep side walls work efficiently to distribute forces, shield the child from vehicle intrusion, contain the head and body, and keep the head, neck, and spine aligned to limit injury.Superior 360-Degree Protection FeaturesThe Frontier 85 features an advanced, industry-leading design for crash force management and absorption. The patented Versa-Tether system provides a staged-release tether webbing that securely anchors the top of the child seat to your vehicle at two points to minimize forward movement in the event of a sudden stop.The energy-absorbing base is designed to absorb impact forces, while the foam lining provides additional support. In addition, the Harness Ultra Guard System (HUGS) reduces forward head movement and offers increased protection for your child.The Frontier 85 is also compatible with the SecureGuard feature. The optional SecureGuard clip holds the lap portion of the safety belt in place, preventing submarining--when the child slides under the lap belt--and reducing the risk of any abdominal injury.Adaptable to Your Growing ChildThe tangle-free, five-point harness allows for 10 harness-height positions--up to an industry-leading 20 inches in shoulder harness height--and three buckle positions for a snug, comfortable fit, even as your child grows. You can also adjust the head restraint with one hand using the quick-adjust lever and easily change the harness shoulder height without disassembling the entire harness. Plus, the convenient front harness adjuster allows you to loosen or tighten the harness system easily.The booster seat can be used in the forward-facing harnessed position for children a minimum of two years old, weighing 25 to 85 pounds, the highest capacity in five-point harness systems. As a belt-positioning booster seat, the seat is suited for children from 40 to 120 pounds.Easy-to-InstallThe Frontier 85 allows for quick, easy installation with lower LATCH connectors, compatible with most current vehicles. The premium, push-button system provides a tight, secure fit and makes it simple to install or remove the seat.
