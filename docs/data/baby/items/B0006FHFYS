{"asin": "B0006FHFYS", "description": "Fisher-Price&#x92;s Aquarium-themed baby gear collection receives raves from most parents for offering multiple soothing methods without over-stimulating baby&#x92;s senses. The two-position seat on this swing reclines and rotates 90 degrees to rock side to side for newborns, simulating the movement of a cradle. The swing also props up and adjusts to move back and forth, providing comforting motion for older infants. Parents are sure to find a pace that works best to calm their fussy baby from among the swing&#x92;s six different speeds. If movement alone doesn&#x92;t work, the swing plays eight different songs and three relaxing ocean sounds at the volume level of choice. And, if that still doesn&#x92;t do the trick, there is an overhead water globe that catches baby&#x92;s eye with its swimming sea creatures and flashing lights or baby can watch the four plush fish encircle overhead on the motorized mobile. A toy tray with an attached bead bar entertains babies during waking hours. The soft seat pad and infant head support cushion baby comfortably and are covered in a fun aquatic fabric that is machine-washable. This swing supports babies that weigh between 0 and 25 pounds and requires four \"D\" batteries for operation.--Cristina Vaamonde", "title": "Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Cradle Swing", "price": 149.99, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41QIXgONIrL._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_viewed": ["B0092YYGMS", "B000NW5RWQ", "B000I2WAY4", "B00F2MQ7XK", "B002OOWABW", "B0080D59XM", "B0045K616S", "B00CWN3JQ0", "B0085425Y2", "B000I5UZ1Q", "B0018Z6910", "B0042D69WO", "B000MUBWTG", "B0011MQLNQ", "B0042D69WY", "B000VHHTG0", "B00BWYPGGQ", "B006SIEN6U", "B00B9ZRYZY", "B00E3RKC72", "B00IVNEGLW", "B007700RMC", "B00BH0T0DK", "B00B8UEBKQ", "B004I1T8AK", "B002OOWABM", "B0075M4RXC", "B00AO084CW", "B0088CO3J6", "1889392332", "B00012CHFI", "B005VLXIS4", "B00AO083KU", "B000I2USMA", "B00CWN3FRS", "B00CWN3FNW", "B001GQ2RZ8", "B000I2WB6G", "B0032B500O", "B00F2MQ82K", "B004PRRWN2", "B000M4K4BY", "B004YF4HPQ", "B00BH0SZ2C", "B003VIIUDW", "B007MV0YMO", "B00HETP0JQ", "B008QPXBI4", "B00E3RKC36", "B003PN66I4", "B004C43JI0", "B005VWO8F0", "B00A4B34IA", "B002SAPIYI", "B000TFGUC8", "B005V9CUC6"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0042D69WY", "B00B9ZRYZY", "B0092YYGMS", "B0042D69WO"]}, "categories": [["Baby"]]}
