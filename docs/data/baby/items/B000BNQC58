Plush and soft, with a sturdy plastic shell, this nightlight is best placed on the floor in the center of the room, where it projects a starry night sky onto the ceiling and walls. For interactive fun, parents can also sit with their children and identify and describe the features of eight major constellations, including the Big Dipper and the Big Bear, with the help of the beautifully illustrated Star Guide. The Twilight Turtle also includes a warm-hearted story about how Twilight Turtle, separated from his father, uses the constellations to find his way home.User-Friendly OperationSimply pressing the button on the turtle's shell ignites the stars and keeps them glowing for a full 45 minutes--just enough time for most children to drift into sleep. At this point, the Twilight Turtle automatically shuts off to preserve battery life. Another push of the button reactivates the projection. In addition, the easy selection of the three soothing color choices allows your child not only to learn to identify different colors, but also to truly experience them as well. Amber radiates warmth and peace; green creates a healing and renewing atmosphere; and blue helps calm the senses. The soft, illuminating glow the Twilight Turtle emits also serves as a nightlight that makes the darkness less frightening.Makes a Great GiftA great gift for children who are afraid of the dark, or even adults who have trouble falling asleep, the Twilight Turtle runs on three \"AAA\" batteries (included). It also comes with a certification of adoption, and measures a compact 14.0 x 5.0 inches (WxH), so it's easy to display and store.About Cloud bCloud b, the baby sleep specialist, was established by two new mothers with the philosophy that every baby deserves a sound night's sleep for healthy development.
