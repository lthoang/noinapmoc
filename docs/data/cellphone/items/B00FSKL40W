With its lightly glowing head, this cable allows you to turn the lights out before you hop into bed without worrying about fumbling for your charger to plug in your device for the night. The small LED light in the head of the cable will help you find the cable easily, and will also help you find the port on your device.PLEASE NOTE:Please be aware that the LED does not turn off unless unplugged, so if you are sensitive to light while sleeping, you will need to put the cable out of sight or covered.  It is rather bright in a dark room.  We do sell another version of this cable with a dim LED that will not disturb sleep.  Search \"DCKM340\" to find the dim version if you prefer a light that is not as bright.Lose the Tangles:To top things off, this cable features a flat cable design, meaning far less tangles and knots in your cord!Perfect For Use with the Dockem Smartphone and Tablet Wall Mount:With your cord safely stored in the Dockem cord holder, the light up head makes it super easy to find your dock in the dark, and also super easy to find the charging port on your device.Please note:This cable should have a Dockem \"(O)\" logo on the large USB end. If it does not, it is likely you have received a knock-off and should contact Dockem ASAP.", "title": "LED Light Up Micro USB Cable - Bright Version - 1 meter (3 ft) Universal Charging and Data Sync Cord with Flat Tangle Free Noodle Ribbon style, White LED Lighted Head Cable for Android Smartphones and Tablets (Samsung, Motorola, HTC, Droid, Blackberry, ASUS, Google, Acer, HP, Galaxy) DCKM341", "price": 5.99, "salesRank": {"Cell Phones & Accessories": 9433}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41o2frYsIqL._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00GCFSLK8", "B00GCFSLFS", "B00EVX9GJI", "B00EI3YK5G", "B00ICHR740", "B00FZLMJJO", "B00HG1BJCO", "B00G5K3B46", "B00COKLQNY", "B00FZLMIZE", "B00G9G6CYM", "B00KXCEWKY", "B00D2OLSP2", "B00KYAMLTY", "B00HG1BJA6", "B00FAADBHO", "B00HPTU00E", "B00FZLMK6Q", "B008618CKK", "B00HVZ8H52", "B00KXCEWL8", "B00HZXYYQ6", "B00FZLMI6I", "B00J2SQL1S", "B00FAAGNLU", "B00EJU86WG", "B00GMQZPSI", "B00GTGETFG", "B00ISGCAJM", "B00HG1BJBU", "B00G9G6CXS", "B00EB03KIY", "B009W34X5O", "B00IBDOB5I", "B00HG1BJAG", "B00D2OLUZ0", "B004GF8TIK", "B00GYKMENG", "B00DVH62J2", "B00GS9CLO0", "B0073FCPSK", "B00IKCI6X8", "B00ENZ04MW", "B00F40A2HM", "B00HQRIVLK", "B008DVMRXG", "B000FHBEFS", "B00GRRTZXS", "B00FRB912U", "B00GC4AJOU", "B007Z419BI", "B00HAQBEH0", "B00HR7J3CA", "B00D82O68Y", "B00HTA0AJ0", "B00H2FK7O0", "B0088U4YAG", "B00B8L36A6", "B00FQVZOSQ", "B00J1VXI0I", "B00EI8SS4U", "B00FEZFJ5W", "B007IOHPRW", "B00DP0PW78", "B00ECV7E4I", "B009QZH7BU", "B003YKX6WC", "B0042IS1Q6", "B00FKPJJNY", "B0045XRK06", "B00B8M4IMK", "B007154KSK", "B009W34X1I", "B004OZMWUS", "B00D3PGU94", "B004MMEHKG", "B0046Y7OZA", "B00CTUIT20", "B00HTTN4NK", "B0037H9P4A", "B005H3Q57M", "B007PSPQ7W", "B007Z494P6", "B00CTM5L0Q", "B003YKX6WM", "B004GUS4XK", "B003ES5ZSW"], "bought_together": ["B00GCFSLK8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00GCFSLK8", "B00GCFSLFS", "B00EI3YK5G", "B00G5K3B46"]}}
