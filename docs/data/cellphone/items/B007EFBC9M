The Motorola Elite Sliver headset provides excellent audio with increased clarity and richer sound from HD Audio Plus with true wideband audio and CrystalTalk dual-mic technology. Keep on talking--the Elite Sliver will keep up with you with its 15 hours of talk time (and 35 days of standby time).\n\nIn addition to voice communication, the Elite Sliver can initiate text messages using the MotoSpeak app (compatible with Android phones), which enables you to read and respond to texts without lifting a finger. With Tap to Pair functionality, the Elite Sliver easily pairs by tapping the charging case against a phone with integrated Near Field Communication (NFC) technology. (Available with NFC-enabled phones that support NFC Bluetooth pairing.)\n\nGet audible updates on phone status with Voice Prompts and listen to music or audio streamed from your phone with the embedded A2DP streaming audio profile. The Elite Sliver can be worn in either ear thanks to its swiveling earpiece.\n\nDictate texts hands-free as well as hear your texts and the sender's name read aloud. MotoSpeak also allows you to stay informed by announcing callers' names to you, and it can translate 150 text acronyms--such as lol, btw and l8r--so you will never miss the meaning of a message. Get started by downloading the free MotoSpeak app from the Amazon Appstore.\n\nWith CrystalTalk dual-mic noise cancellation, the Motorola Elite Sliver lets your caller focus on the conversation without having to worry about distracting noises. Never let background commotion cut your call short again. Due to the packaging of this item there may be slight scratches on the charging pod."}
