No additional licenses needed for extra countries, regions or services like traffic information or city guides. Data charges from network operators may apply.Voice Guidance and Traffic InformationTurn-by-turn, voice guided navigation comes free for both drivers and pedestrians. For drivers this includes lane assistance, traffic information, safety camera, and speed warnings. For pedestrians, this includes shortcuts through parks and pedestrian-only zones for over 100 cities around the world as well as 6,000 3D landmarks in over 200 cities to help you find exactly where you are.Unique Hybrid TechnologyOvi Maps is built on an advanced technology called hybrid vector maps. Vector maps are high quality but less data intensive and allow you to continue to navigate even if you lose your network connection. This means that maps downloaded or updated across a network connection are about half the size of bulky bitmaps used by other mobile map providers. The hybrid technology ensures that, unlike other providers, any downloaded map data is stored on the device for future use.No Network Connection Required When NavigatingAvoid expensive, battery-draining network connections with Nokia's unique hybrid technology. Maps can be pre-loaded on to your Nokia smartphone so you can set Ovi Maps to offline mode, saving battery power, and the navigation system will still work. This is particularly useful for those worried about data connection costs when travelling abroad or when you are travelling through areas with little or no network coverage.Best Global CoverageYou take your mobile with you wherever you go in the world so, as standard, voice guided navigation for both pedestrians and drivers is available for 74 countries in 46 different languages and there are maps for over 180 countries. This gives you the best maps with the largest global coverage for free.Technical SpecificationsMusic playback file formats: AAC, AAC+, eAAC+, MP3, AMR-NB, WMAFM radio 87.5-108 MHz with RDS supportVideo playback file formats: .mp4, AVC/H.264, .wmv, RV, Flash Video, H.263/3GPPVideo streaming: .mp4, AVC/H.264, .wmv, RV, Flash Video, H.263/3GPPVideo recording file formats: .mp4 - default (VGA, QVGA) or .3gp (QCIF for MMS)3.5 mm Nokia audio connectorMicro-USB connector supports charging; USB PictBridge printingBluetooth 2.0 with Enhanced Data RateUPnP supportSupport for PC synchronization with Nokia PC Suite 7.1 (preinstalled) and Nokia Ovi SuiteE-mail supported protocols: IMAP4 (with idle), Nokia Messaging, Microsoft ActiveSync, POP3, SMTPSupport for Nokia Messaging service, Mail for Exchange, Lotus Notes Traveler", "title": "Nokia E72 Unlocked Phone Featuring GPS with Voice Navigation - U.S. Version with Full Warranty (Zodium Black)", "price": 118.49, "salesRank": {"Cell Phones & Accessories": 91355}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51hmy8NeW3L._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B003BWEVS6", "B000U0LYHS", "B001BZJ54U", "B0069IV6Q4", "B002ZGMVEK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B001BZJ54U", "B007MPZT2K", "B001CEY3M4", "B002LHBAG8"]}}
