You can use the extra power during the day to keep you going until night-time charging, on your plane ride to avoid getting bored with in-flight entertainment, while camping, on a road trip, business trip, or any other occasion where having some more power can make the difference between enjoying your iPhone and a blank screen = boredom.The black and white color variations go really well with both black and white iPhone, so it looks like a custom-made jacket for your iPhone without affecting your style one bit!The battery case comes with a high quality mini USB charging cable that can be connected to any standard USB wall or car charger. Once installed, you no longer need to take your iPhone in and out of the case, as charging the case and iPhone can take place simultaneously. Simply connect the case to a USB charger and watch both the iPhone battery and the case battery charge simultaneously.The case has a built-in overcharge protection, which turns the battery charging function off when your phone battery reaches 100%.
