The case comes in two pieces. The inner part is a soft silicone, which snugly grips your iPhone and provides shock protection for the back and sides. It also protects the finish of your iPhone from scratch and dings caused by normal daily use. The outer polycarbonate shell fits over the inner silicone skin and provides an extra layer of shock protection, combining with the silicone skin to disperse and absorb the shock forces from the point of impact. The polycarbonate shell is somewhat pliant, allowing it to be easily fit over the silicone skin and ensuring it will not easily shatter or crack. The iPhone volume and power controls are covered by the pliant silicone skin, allow them to be easily manipulated through the skin. Cutouts on the cases provide access to the camera/flash, docking connector, headphone jack, etc. The cutout for the mute button is large enough to accommodate the placement of either the original iPhone 4 or the later variants, including the iPhone 4S."}
