We believe our anti-glare finish offers a good balance between clarity and glare/fingerprint resistance. For maximum clarity we recommend HD clear screen protectors, but if you frequently use your device outdoors or in bright lighting, you might want to consider having screen protectors that offer the anti-glare technology and reduces amount of visible fingerprints.
