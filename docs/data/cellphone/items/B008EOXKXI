We hope to now achieve the same in the US by providing you with the same high-quality products and caring after-sales support!http://www.amazon.co.uk/shops/mediadevilMediaDevil's Magicscreen Screen Protector: Matte Clear edition protects your screen from scratches, reduces screen glare, and leaves no markings when removed. It does not reduce the touch sensitivity of the device screen.An essential accessory that is also available in a Crystal Clear (Invisible) edition.IMPORTANT:The Samsung Galaxy S3 is curved at each of its four sides. As a result, it isnotpossible for our screen protectors to cover the entire screen.Please view the illustration we have provided in the image section of this product page, of the area of the screen that these particular screen protectors cover.PLEASE NOTE:Matte material protectors do produce a pixellation of the screen clarity, as this is the natural effect created by the Matte (anti-glare) frosted texture. It is simply an unavoidable 'Law of Physics'.You will see this pixellation on all anti-glare screen protectors from all brands (many of which are noticeably more extreme than ours). Apple's matte screen monitors (and professional television industry monitors) display it also, as it is unavoidable.If you require a perfectly 'crystal clear' screen to enjoy the screen clarity to its full extent, westronglyrecommend purchasing our (glossy surface textured) Magicscreen Crystal Clear edition instead:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008EOXKTMYour satisfaction is really important to us, and we will do our best to help ensure that you are a happy MediaDevil customer.-tt.", "title": "MediaDevil Magicscreen Screen Protector: Matte Clear (Anti-Glare) - Samsung Galaxy SIII / S3 (2 x Screen protectors).", "price": 9.97, "salesRank": {"Cell Phones & Accessories": 54248}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514ASHzMd7L._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B008EOXKTM", "B008EPW2AE", "B009FXMWGI", "B00C0EUW34", "B008EPW1MI", "B009Z2S3N0", "B00AGA6FLC", "B008J2V3KW", "B0088OJXE4", "B009FXMVO6", "B008AGA6PK", "B008EPW1KA", "B008D4XCXM", "B0088LYCZC", "B008EME2Z0", "B004ZXZK4O", "B008B85DNC", "B008EME2BY", "B00A44JSFK", "B008DJIKHU", "B0089YS4CK", "B009B1XZ6U", "B008D4X97Q", "B003VPT5U2", "B00GHDLR4C", "B00C0EUVVM", "B0087GAOE6", "B008D4XBII", "B008ATCEUC", "B008DKCIPO", "B008D4XEUI", "B00AKZWGAC", "B008EMZ7E0", "B008QT1STE", "B00B0IS6MU", "B0087GANO2", "B00IIND1J8", "B0089F2ILM", "B009FXMWIG", "B008CZO7R2", "B008ATCSBC", "B008FYFSBY", "B008DO50N2", "B0085JRQQE", "B008EOXLJQ", "B0085JRQFU", "B00B7INU60", "B00BMQ56QE", "B009Z2S3I0", "B00GCG3O6S", "B008UE8YKG", "B0089VO7QU", "B008D4XEO4", "B008FFW3W0", "B008H6386M", "B008DJIJL2", "B004GF8TIK", "B00AAJM81A", "B0085JRQOQ", "B0087GAP40", "B009PRKIJ2", "B008JJT8UW", "B0084F4HY8", "B00HVLNST6", "B008S3MB7G", "B00A8S5ICO", "B009QZH7BU", "B00BZGQ854", "B008ASZ4KU", "B008AT7PYW", "B009N7TR2S", "B0087GAMUC", "B008N6J3F6", "B009LY0LJQ", "B008F19VZ6", "B009B1XY0W", "B00849E1CM", "B008N6I45Q", "B00D8YYT3O", "B008HTJLF6", "B0089VO7OM", "B00AEE344G", "B0088E4CUY", "B008UE92VG", "B008DJIIG8", "B0085JRQZU", "B00BQ3HY1I", "B008JRSTEU", "B008UHLFRC"], "bought_together": ["B008EPW2AE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AGA6FLC", "B0088OJXE4", "B0088LYCZC", "B008EOXKTM"]}}
