On the outside is a hard outer shell made from an advanced polycarbonate mix for better shock absorbancy and durability. It covers the areas of the phone that are most prone to damage and is designed to take the first hit, and is designed to flex rather than break or shatter. Our unique triple coating feels great in your hand and is scratch resistant. Underneath is our second layer, an inner protective layer of TPU which surrounds the back and sides of the phone, absorbing the rest of the shock should you drop it. Our unique design gives the same or more protection as popular high-end protective cases but without all the bulk - the Ultra is thinner and weighs just under an ounce. The case looks great, and if you like you can purchase additional Ultra PC and Ultra TPU covers to customize the look with 35 color combinations."}
