Our goal was to create something small, simple, and elegant. But out of this simple design emerges countless uses. Mount your iPhone to a tripod for taking great pictures or making movies. Prop your iPhone up for hands-free FaceTiming or to watch videos. All of that and more in a compact design that is manufactured in America.\n\nThe Glif is made from recyclable rubberized plastic that feels great and plays nice with your phone, and is small enough to fit snugly in your pocket, purse, or backpack. It has a 1/4\"-20 thread that fits any standard tripod or camera mount. The Glif is designed to work with a \"naked\" (caseless) iPhone and is compatible with the iPhone 5.\n\nThe Serif is designed to keep your iPhone incredibly secure on the tripod. While the Glif is great for normal use, the Serif will keep your phone safe in more extreme situations. And, when you are not using the Serif, it fits snuggly inside the Glif, making it very compact. \n\nAdditionally, the Glif+ comes with the Ligature, a simple keyring loop that attaches to the tripod thread on the Glif. Now, you'll have a way to always keep your Glif handy, by attaching it to your keychain, backpack, purse, or anything, really.", "title": "Glif Plus: A deluxe Glif package, iPhone 5 Tripod Mount &amp; Stand", "price": 30.0, "salesRank": {"Cell Phones & Accessories": 40830}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31Ir5i7kZRL._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B000EVSLRO", "B00AFXUUV6", "B008JFTK22", "B00A9SMVMS", "B00CTUOSYS", "B00EO4A7L0", "B00HQO5VJ8", "B0058DC1FG", "B00JK5OW8C", "B00BHN05H2", "B00AFXUWJQ", "B0042FZA1S", "B00GV472VY", "B00GXOYHPQ", "B00GV44HAS", "B009GHYMB6", "B007WPKIOO", "B001CITVNQ", "B006W8Z4FK", "B0038YWLCA", "B004Z97CQW", "B0052G679K", "B00GV45I24", "B00DEH62QC", "B00JK5OVCE", "B00AAKERD6", "B007WPKIOE", "B00824948U", "B000068NZF", "B008DWGLLO", "B0087FFTT2", "B002HJ9PTO", "B00DUFRIG6", "B00F8U0QBK", "B00H880AZC", "B003SQEAY0", "B009GHYM0M", "B00FS5L9D4", "B00D76RNLS", "B007EW9ISM", "B008BSCWXQ", "B0050K3DW2", "B007534LFK", "B00I0BBN1G", "B00CPK46TY", "B004XC6KHS", "B00DOMUFRO", "B00C8ADTN0", "B000VA4CK8", "B000T95Q1U", "B00C11ASSA", "B00C7J5ZC0", "B008EQFI86", "B00F19Q7AC", "B006N5B9BK", "B0099Y21ZA", "B008NPBEJA", "B00HWMG44U", "B001T9AGLE", "B0000YD2JC", "B000SZVZ74", "B004URTJ6U", "B005HY4U4Q", "B0060F03PQ", "B00EGWHTUC", "B00E3ALGVA", "B00BQ3ECLS", "B00DDF9QM2", "B00B3Y4FAS", "B005KP473Q", "B0092SPRDQ", "B002GYPS3M", "B00ANOI3YS", "B004SP0WAQ", "B002FGTWOC", "B004TJ6JH6", "B000VRLX9Y", "B00DIGYGDA", "B0084UYD1U", "B00AZBV0Q2", "B00IL7BJMM", "B002CVU4G0", "B001QWBM62", "B009GHYLKS", "B000L47AHG", "B00A2BW8HU", "B004K8WPUQ", "B000T95T08", "B004ZGN6MY", "B0018LQVIA", "B004ZGLM5W", "B000B73QDU", "B009SYZ8OC", "B005MZO5TA", "B0024NKGZK", "B00BKRQ4E8", "B009FFW8KQ", "B0099SMFP2"], "bought_together": ["B000EVSLRO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00HQO5VJ8", "B00AAKERD6", "B009GHYMB6", "B000EVSLRO"]}}
