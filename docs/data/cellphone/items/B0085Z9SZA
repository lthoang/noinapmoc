Users consider it more of a love affair, an amorous adventure into new realms of ever expanding communication that's audiovisual. Moshi's iVisor XT for iPhone 4 or 4s makes it all clearer.The new iVisor XT features a completely clear screen, for optimal visual performance. It also serves iPhone users most interested in a glossier screen finish, versus the less reflective surface of anti-glare screen protectors.Like Moshi's previous iVisors, the iVisor XT is an advanced screen protector designed to protect an iPhone's touch screen from scratches and smudges. Unlike other protectors that require tedious installation procedures and often result in unwanted air bubbles or hindered touch screen performance, Moshi's proprietary design and patented technology allows the iVisor to be installed in seconds without bubbles, making it the easiest screen protector to install on the market. Further, its multi-layer construction enables unimpeded touch sensitivity while retaining clarity."}
