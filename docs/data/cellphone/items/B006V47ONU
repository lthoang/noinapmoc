Combined with the speed of the powerful dual-core 1.5 GHz processor and the Android 2.3 OS, you'll enjoy enhanced multitasking abilities and smooth game play. Measuring a mere 9.49mm (0.37 inches) at its thinnest from front to back, the Galaxy S II Skyrocket easily it slips in and out of your pocket even with its huge 4.5-inch Super AMOLED Plus multi-touch display--perfect for immersing yourself in cinema-quality video while on the go. The Samsung Galaxy S II Skyrocket runs the Android 2.3 operating system (dubbed Gingerbread)--the fastest version of Android available for smartphones yet. It features a cleaner, more refined interface with new icons, improved top notification bar, and more intuitive navigation. Multitasking in Gingerbread allows you the ability to run more than one app at a time. If you're playing a game, you can easily switch to an incoming e-mail and then switch back to the game without losing your place. And like the previous version of Android (\"Froyo\"), Gingerbread provides support for Adobe Flash Player 10.1 for access to the full Web. The onscreen keyboard makes it easier to type thanks to additional spacing between the keys and larger font sizes. And the more you use the keyboard, the easier typing will be as the enhanced suggest feature records previous input history to make better suggestions. The Galaxy S II Skyrocket also brings one-touch access to the popular Google mobile services you use every day. It also provides easy access to both personal and corporate e-mail, calendars, and contacts supported by Exchange Server and Gmail. And through Android Market, you'll get access to thousands of useful applications, widgets, and fun games to download and install on your phone, with many more apps being added every day."}
