The multilayer Defender Series case for Galaxy Note 10.1 protects from damage against your device, decreasing the money you spend on replacement technology. A built-in screen protector helps keep the glass display scratch, smudge and ding-free while port covers block dust and debris from coming in but still allowing for easy access to the Samsung Note 10.1&#x2019;s features. Don&#x2019;t forget the shield stand -this included accessory provides added protection when transporting your device and doubles as a media-viewing stand. With this Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 case, you&#x2019;ll keep your device looking like the day you bought it."}
