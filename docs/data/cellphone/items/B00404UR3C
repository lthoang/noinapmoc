This is what people are referring to in the negative reviews. It gives the illusion of a \"Screen Protector Free\" phone. If this is your first time installing a protector, it may take a few tries to get it perfectly aligned. You may remove and reapply as many times as you would like. There is no need to waste another protector. You can simply peel it back and reapply. Having a smaller sized screen protector would not provide a sleek look and would leave parts unprotected. The final results are worth the small extra effort.Halo Screen Protectors offers the highest quality and highest rated screen protectors available on the market today. Halo Screen Protectors consist of multi-layer Grade A Japanese Film which insures optimum protection and leaves your screen protected for a lifetime. Screen protectors are designed to offer zero to minimal bubbles during application, easy to install, and are reusable.
