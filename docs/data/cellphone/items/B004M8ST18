This mount package includes Arkon&#x2019;s Mobile Grip Smartphone Holder, a Travelmount Deluxe Mini Windshield or Dashboard Suction Car Mount, and a circular 3M adhesive dashboard mounting disk. The Mobile Grip spring-loaded holder expands to accommodate smartphones (even those with skins or ruggedized cases) up to 2.75 inches wide. Its simplistic yet effective design keeps rear smartphone cameras free for spontaneous pictures and videos. The Mobile Grip&#x2019;s spring-loaded mechanism makes it easy to insert or remove the smartphone from the holder with one hand, yet holds the smartphone securely. The Travelmount Deluxe Mini Windshield or Dashboard Suction Car Mount features a standard suction mount base made of thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU). The arm of the windshield suction car dock mount adjusts vertically and provides 360-degree rotation, giving you the ultimate flexibility in viewing the cell phone from any angle. If using a larger smartphone such as the Samsung Galaxy S5 or previous Galaxy S models (such as the Galaxy S4 or S3), the Samsung Galaxy Mega, Galaxy Note 3, or Note 2, Arkon recommends the new Mobile Grip 2 Universal Smartphone Windshield Sticky Suction Mount Model MG279 (also available on Amazon). Several comments regarding the MG115 mount (mostly from 2012) mention a drooping effect of the holder after limited use or in warm temperatures. Arkon addressed this issue in early 2013 with a significant materials upgrade, which eliminated the drooping action of the product. The more recent 5-star reviews reflect this change. If you&#x2019;re still concerned, try Model MG279 instead. The MG279 features a swivel tightening ring that prevents any slipping of the holder, even with the heaviest and largest of smartphones."}
