When Nintendo released the GameBoy in the late 1980's it revolutionized the gaming industry. Super Mario, Tetris and Zelda became portable! I miss that little \"ping\" noise it made when you turned it on....that grainy green screen captivated me as a child. Pay tribute to the old-school GameBoy with this unique phone skin. The skin is made to look like the GameBoy with all its classic features: D-Pad, start, select, B button, A button. This rubber skin offers protection for your phone and great feeling grip. The skin also helps prevent your cell phone from sliding across your car's dashboard or other slick or angled surface. The item is simple to install. All you do is insert the phone in the skin and stretch/wrap around the perimeter and you're set! This is not a hard plastic case - this is a soft/flexible/rubbery material. Your phone is fully functional in the case. The skin has holes for the speaker, camera, flash, headset. Protect your phone in style with this classic case! NOTE. if your phone does not work in the skin, try blowing some air into cartridge - works every time! (that was a joke)"}
