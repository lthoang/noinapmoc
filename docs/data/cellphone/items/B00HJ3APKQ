Moreover, the inner shell's matte finish resists fingerprints when slipping your Note 3 in and out of the case.Minimal bulk.Ultra-slim and precision-cut, this case adds only a fraction of an inch and 1.1oz to your phone. Keep your slim-profiled phone slim and not only add protection, but also add your own gripping flare at the same time.Case-and-wallet.Out for a walk, or quick shopping trip? Featuring cards and cash slots, make your phone your wallet and take everything all-in-one. This upgraded version features a simpler and less bulky design to provide a more practical yet fully functional experience.S Pen compatible.Upgraded with a snap instead of a magnetic latch, this case won't fall victim to the S Pen dead-spot resulting from constantly exposing the screen to a magnetic field.Viewing ease.Frameless inner-case design avoids diminishing your screen size by 0.1inch.
