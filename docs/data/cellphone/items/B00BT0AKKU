It has a 1A USB charging slot and can charge any device that charges VIA USB. However it only includes a MICRO USB cable so you will need a OEM Cable to charge any device that does not charge VIA MICRO USB. The 4 blue LED status indicators let you know how much charge power is remaining--when all four blue LEDs are on, you've got a full battery, and are ready to go! Charging times for devices depend on individual specifications.Compatible with Most Cell Phones:Apple:iPhone 5 4S 4 3 3GS / ipod touch/classic/nano/ iPad/ iPad 2(OEM Cable Required)HTCOne X V S / Sensation XE XL / Thunderbolt / EVO 3D / EVO 4G / Evo Shift 4gSamsungGalaxy S3 S2 / Note 1 2 / Epic 4G / Galaxy NexusBlackberryCurve / Storm 2 / Tour Style / BoldMotorolaDroid Razr Maxx / Atrix / BionicNokiaN900 / N8 / N97 / C6 / C3 C7 / E7 / X6LGOptimus , 2x , V , S , T / Quantum / VortexSonyExperia ARC Arc / Neo / Play / MiniAmazonKindle Fire, HD, DX and all other kindlesOthersNook Tablet, Color, NDS, Portable Wifi, PSP(NOT compatible with PSP vista)Specs:- Average Charging time for iPhones 1.5 hrs- Input Charging Time 5 - 6 hrs- Life Cycle &gt; 500 Times- Input: Micro USB 5V/1000mA(Max)- Output: USB 5V/1A (5W)Package Includes:EB-5200 Battery PackUser GuideMicro USB cable", "title": "Hipo By Ivation CS-5200 5200mAh (5V/1A output) Portable Power Bank External Backup Battery and Charger for all iPhones, iPods, iPads, phones, Smart Phones, Cambers, and any Electric item that Charges VIA USB", "price": 19.95, "salesRank": {"Cell Phones & Accessories": 202722}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/313ryJJGvPL._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00BFY59BA", "B0073FE1F0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00BFY59BA", "B00DGJJNVO", "B00BFY599C", "B005NF5NTK"]}}
