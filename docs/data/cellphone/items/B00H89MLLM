It also fits midsize tablets, including the Galaxy Tab Pro 8.4, Galaxy Tab 3 7.0 and 8.0, Galaxy Note 8.0, iPad mini, and Kindle Fire HD. This mount package includes Arkon&#x2019;s Slim-Grip Ultra Universal Holder and a sticky suction deluxe windshield or dashboard car mount with one-touch lever. The mount is ideal for car dashboards, windshields, and other flat or slightly textured surfaces. The sticky suction base uses a powerful combination of polyurethane gel and suction to provide a maximum surface bond. In order to prevent permanent indentation marks on soft vinyl, leather, or similar dashboard surfaces, Arkon recommends using the included 3M adhesive mounting disk. The sticky suction mount is also easily removable and reusable. To restore the suction, just rinse the pad with a mild liquid soap and warm water then air dry. The smartphone or tablet is held securely in place with the spring-loaded holder, and can be inserted or removed from the mount with one hand. Included with the holder are 8 support legs (4 short and 4 longer versions) that can be customized to fit your smartphone. The top and bottom adjustable-leg design of the Slim-Grip Ultra helps keep any side buttons and ports unobstructed. For most smartphones, the ideal mount holder configuration is to attach 2 short support legs on top and the 2 long support legs on the bottom of the holder. For larger smartphones, use the 4 long support legs on the holder. For smaller smartphones, use the 4 short support legs on the holder. The arm of the suction mount adjusts vertically and provides 360&#xB0; rotation, providing flexibility in viewing the smartphone from any angle."}
