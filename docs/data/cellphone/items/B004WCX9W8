The case helps protect your phone from scratches, bumps, and falls. It allows for easy access to all of your phones functions and ports.Unlike similar case this has no visible logo on the outside so you can protect your investment without cluttering it with advertising. Additionally, the power button is exposed which is important so it's easier to \"wake\" and \"sleep\" your screen. Other cases cover this button making it harder to push.TPU cases have a really good grip. It holds firm on the dashboard of your car, and will never slip out of your pocket (well, rarely!).
