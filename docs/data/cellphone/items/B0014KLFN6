This version of the Nokia N95 (model N95-4) has an internal 8 GB memory, and it doesn't include a MicroSD expansion slot.This unlocked cell phone can be used with a GSM network service provider and it provides quad-band connectivity (850 MHz, 900 MHz, 1800 MHz, 1900 MHz). It does not come with a SIM card, and it requires that you provide a SIM card for usage with your selected service provider.Phone FeaturesThe innovative 2-way slide concept makes it easy to switch between different modes, going from reading maps to watching a video with a simple slide. A numeric keypad slides out from one end of the device while dedicated media keys slide out from the opposite direction, converting the display into full screen landscape mode.With the Carl Zeiss optics on the 5-megapixel camera, you can capture print quality photos and DVD-like quality video clips. Carl Zeiss, a world leader in high quality camera lenses, brings an award-winning legacy to the Nokia N95 with state-of-the-art optics for mobile photography and mobile video. The Zeiss name has been associated with cameras from Hasselblad, Rollei, Yashica, Sony, and Nikon.The N95 slides two ways to reveal a phone keypad (top) and media controls (bottom).The Nokia N95 actually has two cameras, a high resolution camera on the back of the device (the main camera in landscape mode) and a lower resolution camera on the front (CIF resolution, 352 x 288).

(Note that the low-resolution camera on the front can provide two-way video calling; however, at this time no U.S. carrier offers this service.) You can use both cameras to take still pictures and record videos. Images are saved as JPEG files while videos are recorded in the MPEG-4 file format with the .mp4 file extension, or in the 3GPP file format with the .3gp file extension (sharing quality). Photos and video clips can be enjoyed on a compatible television thanks to the device's TV out feature and support for Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) technology.With instant access to the Internet, sharing life experiences with the world by uploading pictures and videos directly to popular picture sharing and blogging sites is quick and easy.
