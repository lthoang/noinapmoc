Comfortable to wear, XXL-ARMBAND is made of stretchable, sweat-resistant neoprene and features an adjustable elastic armband with reflective safety strips. A touch-compatible plastic cover enables operation of the phone&#x2019;s screen. Also included is a small storage pouch with a nylon hook-and-loop enclosure that&#x2019;s perfect for ID, money, or a key. Cutouts on both the top and bottom of the armband provide flexibility for plugging in an audio jack. XXL-ARMBAND is ideal for running, jogging, workouts, or any kind of active lifestyle. For an armband that fits larger smartphones, Arkon recommends ARMBAND5 (4.8&#x201D; up to 5.3&#x201D; screen size or 5.5&#x201D; in height) or ARMBAND6 (5.8&#x201D; up to 6.3&#x201D; screen size or 6.5&#x201D; in height). For smaller smartphones, see Arkon&#x2019;s XL-ARMBAND (3.7&#x201D; up to 4.3&#x201D; screen size or 5&#x201D; in height), or SM-ARMBAND (3.2&#x201D; up to 4&#x201D; screen size or 4.5&#x201D; in height). Note: when choosing an armband for a smartphone with a skin or ruggedized case on it, choose the next largest size than recommended for best results."}
