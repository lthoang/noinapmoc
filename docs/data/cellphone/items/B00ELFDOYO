Affordable generic waterproof cases have arrived! Perfect for trips to the lake, river, waterpark and beach, these will save your phone from accidents that tend to happen during the fun in the sun.\n\nSo your generic waterproof case works properly, please read the installation manual that accompanies the product. Best practice is also to water-test your case in a bucket without your phone inside just to make sure you didn't get a defective product (it happens sometimes, so it's best to check before your phone is at risk) - test it for 5-10 minutes just to be sure. During installation, make sure all of the seals and o-rings seat well, otherwise leaks may result. Keep your ringer switch on as well, so the case fits best. Careful about dropping this case. It's cheaper than the $70 ones both in price and quality, so you'll have to baby it. If you drop it hard, it certainly could break and cause leaks.\n\nThis case is designed to be submersible up to 6 feet and it's sealed from dirt, dust, snow, ice and most importantly, beer pong incidents."}
