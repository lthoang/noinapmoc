{"asin": "B00G26XWDI", "categories": [["Cell Phones & Accessories", "Accessories", "Accessory Kits"]], "description": "Our Simdevil SIM card adapter kit can convert a Nano SIM card into a Micro SIM or a standard SIM card, and a Micro SIM card into a standard SIM card. This is fully reversible, allowing you to switch easily between different devices.Simdevil is perfect for when you need to convert your modern (i.e. small) SIM card into a larger SIM card size, such as when you want to use an older phone on holiday or at a music festival, or when your primary phone is broken.Please Note:without wishing to state the obvious, a SIM card can only be converted into a larger physical size, and not a smaller size.Therefore a Micro SIM cannot be converted to a Nano SIM, and a standard SIM cannot be converted to a Micro SIM or a Nano SIM.Important:1. This is not a memory card adapter, it will only work with SIM cards.2. Do not insert an empty Simdevil adapter into your device.3. As with any SIM card adapter, we advise that you only use Simdevil to adapt pre-cut manufacturer SIM cards.Your satisfaction is really important to us, and we will do our best to help ensure that you are a happy MediaDevil customer.MediaDevil was awarded the UK Department of Trade & Investment (UKTI)'s 2011 Business Innovation Award for\"demonstrating the virtues of excellent products and a passionate company\".", "title": "MediaDevil Simdevil 3-in-1 SIM card adapter kit (Nano / Micro / Standard)", "price": 6.97, "salesRank": {"Cell Phones & Accessories": 222}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/412nulDge2L._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B009P16FKY", "B009QTVG4K", "B0045BIUGG", "B00B5SZHFE", "B00FV1264G", "B00CF5ETH8", "B00HRNM8T4", "B00GQ2HG6C", "B00HSPQZIG", "B009PJFHUK", "B00E3VMQ1I", "B0015EMYJ0", "B009GB6DBO", "B00KKSI496", "B009WTXB5G", "B00D1Z2OR8", "B009B9YWB4", "B00GAIP5CO", "B00K0NRZSW", "B006FY70PI", "B00KCE0KLS", "B00KMM7VU8", "B009IRGQPO", "B00HVTOV94", "B00E3SD8QI", "B002BSO4ZG", "B00GN1YKBU", "B009H6WJ8O", "B008PHQJCI", "B00DFSORCQ", "B00IGISU1E", "B00L9OVUHI", "B00HAFILLS", "B00L9OVC94", "B00GANEUQG", "B005EMS1YG", "B00K0NS0P4", "B00GLJCH32", "B00CDJUJ6G", "B009QZH6JS", "B009ABEA7E", "B009G7AUQ2", "B004003HAG", "B00B4AYPLU", "B00I2LRJG2", "B00FW70ZF6", "B004I58ZVY", "B009QZH7BU", "B0081FVWVC", "B00J3554KE", "B00FZ14E3S", "B00CTTHVUW", "B00F9RRVUG", "B00JW0ASA6", "B0006ZIEUC", "B00K0NRVNG", "B00EV8Y5MQ", "B00E8GQHM2", "B00IIJ6W4S", "B00H02KSCQ", "B00G3P7LA8", "B00H3OUGI2", "B00JDE7N72", "B00EFD4UKY", "B00E45043A", "B00GI2O4KQ", "B00CDJF506", "B00JEMESHG", "B00K33N3GC", "B00K0NRYF6", "B00KIWVCAC", "B004GV13VY", "B00A55Q2HA", "B00IVPU88U", "B00FPTSI9Q", "B00I812LAU", "B001PQPHXS", "B000BU5KJK", "B00D7O8L0M", "B00LBI9B82", "B00JL1490G", "B005ZEWGSA", "B00FJJ38HY", "B00HIW5WW4", "B004RL6QUQ", "B00GURKMP0", "B002CGRLFW", "B00HS5LRC0", "B00JQI2F64", "B00BT1L9ZE", "B00IFHY67I", "B00IX2USWM", "B007WTAJTO", "B004LPZBD6", "B007Z419BI", "B00KVHEL8E", "B00IIYR1YS", "B008CLO7Q2", "B009QZH7D8", "B00GM87WKK"], "bought_together": ["B009P16FKY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00HSPQZIG", "B00CF5ETH8", "B00E3VMQ1I", "B009GB6DBO"]}}
