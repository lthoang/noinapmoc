Safe driving. Truthfully, the safest place for your phone when you&#x2019;re in the car is in the glove box, turned off. But since we all know that&#x2019;s probably not what you&#x2019;re going to do with it, doesn&#x2019;t it make sense to put it someplace where it&#x2019;s securely held and in plain sight? We think so. That&#x2019;s where the Clingo Universal Hands-Free Mount comes in. Clingo keeps it in view. With windshield or dashboard mounting options, the Hands-Free Mount allows you to keep your phone where you can glance at it if you need to, without taking your attention from the road. The highly adjustable ball and socket joint and pivoting arm also provide the flexibility to get the viewing angle just right. And as always, the Clingo sticky pad holds your phone tightly, yet lets it go when you&#x2019;re ready to have it back. Let your phone stick to Clingo, so you can stick to driving. Any phone, anywhere. It&#x2019;s pretty simple, really. Clingo holds any phone. It doesn&#x2019;t matter if it&#x2019;s a BlackBerry, iPhone, Samsung, latest Droid or whatever. Whether in your car, at the office, at home, or wherever - Clingo holds it."}
