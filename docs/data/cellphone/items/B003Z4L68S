This mount package includes Arkon&#x2019;s Slim-Grip spring-loaded universal holder, a low-profile mini windshield one-touch suction mount, and a circular 3M adhesive dashboard mounting disk. A swivel head on the mount provides 360&#xB0; rotation, giving you the ultimate flexibility in viewing the iPhone from any angle. The high-polish, glossy black finish on the holder was specifically designed to complement the iPhone. Included with the holder are 8 support legs (4 short and 4 longer versions). The ideal configuration for the iPhone 4S and previous models is to have 2 short legs on the top of the holder and 2 of the longer support legs on the bottom of the holder. For the iPhone 5S or 5C, use all 4 of the longer support legs with the holder. If using a large, ruggedized case with the iPhone 5C or 5S, Arkon recommends the new, larger Slim-Grip Ultra Mount instead. See Model IPM615, also available on Amazon."}
