It has all the great properties of the GLAS.t, but it's been improved to ensure even longer lasting durability. The R in GLAS.tR stands for the rounded edges of the screen protector. Being made of glass, the edges of the screen protector are the most vulnerable to chipping. The rounded edges helps to deflect shock from bumps and drops. If you loved the GLAS.t, you'll love the GLAS.tR even more! GLAS.tR is 0.4mm thick and made with chemically treated, transparent tempered GLAS.tR. The surface of the GLAS.tR has a hardness of 8-9H, three times better than regular PET film (2H-3H). Even shard objects such as knives and keys will not scratch the GLAS.tR. Although the GLAS.tR has the strong hardness, GLAS.tR does not interfere the touchscreen responsiveness. It works and feels just like the actual screen. The GLAS.tR is coated on the back with a strong silicone adhesive that makes installation easy and attaches the film firmly so as to not affect the touch screen's sensitivity. In case the screen protector cracks from a drop, the GLAS.tR does not shatter. GLAS.tR is tempered to be anti-shatter for your safety. ATTENTION: The included Jelly Bean Home Buttons are only compatible with the iPhone 5C and iPhone 5. The included Back Panel Protector is only compatible with the iPhone 5S and iPhone 5.", "title": "SPIGEN SGP SGP09548 GLAS.tR Premium Tempered Glass Screen Protector for iPhone 5/5S (0.5mm) - 1 Pack - Retail Packaging - Oleophobic Coating", "price": 34.99, "salesRank": {"Cell Phones & Accessories": 87506}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51UkNcvFSpL._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B009WTGZIQ", "B00AHNADS4", "B00BL5FDFK", "B00BL5FBFW", "B00ECHR2M6", "B00ANALDWQ", "B00ECHR1TU", "B009TENKAA", "B00ANALFDI", "B00IIWKQWE", "B00G5S61B8", "B009D4DFM4", "B00ANALH7W", "B009D4IMH2", "B00BGG5MLY", "B00AG3TT8U", "B00AG1A6N4", "B009KPPBSM", "B00CMHRTSA", "B00AG3TTJ4", "B00BSDSDSO", "B00BG54V7G", "B00AJSHIK8", "B00IF5B3H6", "B00BGG5NAE", "B00AG3TRFK", "B00A825RDK", "B00B14YFMI", "B00G3J10I8", "B00BGD8ESA", "B00EOO1RHS", "B009D4I3UI", "B00BSDSCZ8", "B00ADT25ZG", "B00BWE8G04", "B00BGG5LO2", "B00AGMCB5Y", "B00AG3TWNW", "B0097BEFYA", "B00BFIFIPS", "B00D667YUY", "B00AAOWYHI", "B009RKJ3Z2", "B009SPS7LC", "B00CMHRUQ6", "B008SGIQYK", "B00D94RCV4", "B00BWE8GXQ", "B00AG3TTE4", "B0093CDLM0", "B00AG3TW0A", "B00BWE8CWQ", "B00DD5TWXK", "B0098FKKPI", "B009SYZ8OC", "B00D94RETO", "B00FTLGVLC", "B00GN1L626", "B00CZE3HY0", "B00B5KXRZO", "B00BT8L2MW", "B00DMKGPP4", "B00AYNRLFA", "B0092TQHP2", "B00DMKGSOW", "B00CMQTVK0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00BL5FDFK", "B00ECHR2M6", "B00BL5FBFW", "B00DMKGPP4"]}}
