{"asin": "B0087OXNBE", "categories": [["Cell Phones & Accessories", "Cases", "Holsters & Clips"]], "description": "The QuickFlipCase for the Samsung Galaxy S3 (SIII) and new S4 is a soft, premium leather hip case.  This horizontally designed case features smooth leather exterior with classic contrast stitching and a sturdy permanent belt clip. The belt clip has been updated with a metallic tip for durability and we added two internal rivets so the clip stays attached to the case. It also uses a secure magnetic enclosure, and simple center push-up removal to remove your Galaxy S3. You can still access the headphone jack and sleep/wake button and speakers are not covered to allow full speaker volume when inside the case. We designed the case to conform to the Samsung Galaxy S3 but not overly tight. This allows the Galaxy S3 to be removed from the case with just one hand. If for any reason you are not 100% satisfied we will guarantee a replacement of your purchase or a refund. We stand by the our products and look forward to you becoming another happy customer. For US customers, we now offer expedited shipping via USPS Priority Mail (2-4 days after shipping) or you can chose standard shipping via USPS First Class mail.", "title": "QuickFlipCase for Samsung Galaxy SIII , Grantwood Technology Premium Leather Horizontal Flip Case (Black)", "price": 25.0, "salesRank": {"Cell Phones & Accessories": 176800}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41m%2Bw31fLcL._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B008FQWKC2", "B007VOM0R4", "B00849E1CM", "B008ATCSBC", "B008FQVO5G", "B0085GI1S4", "B0081XHMGI", "B00AEE344G", "B00871PHFW", "B008EX4MOU", "B0089VO71U", "B0080630TE", "B008ZZ4B8O", "B009TW36W4", "B008B85DNC", "B0088LYCZC", "B004O6347M", "B007WTAJTO", "B008DKC2UU", "B00A533DWO"], "bought_together": ["B00849E1CM"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00AEE344G", "B004O6347M", "B009TW36W4", "B008FQVO5G"]}}
