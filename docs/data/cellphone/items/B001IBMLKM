A typical cell phone provides merely one-fifth of a watt of output power. To address this problem, the amplifier and the included magnet mount antenna work together to increase the phone's output power by more than 12 times over using just the phone alone.Enjoy Premium Reception and Fewer Dropped CallsLiving or working in an area with limited cell phone coverage, which is caused by natural and man-made obstructions or by living out of range from a cell phone tower, you know how frustrating weak reception can be. By increasing the power output of your cell phone signal, the Wilson MobilePro helps eliminate most of the signal loss caused by these obstructions. It's important to note that the strongest signal is obtained when the MobilePro is within two feet of your cell phone, laptop, or data card. If you sit at a distance greater than two feet, simply set your phone next to the MobilePro booster and use a Bluetooth headset.The MobilePro comes with several power options, including a vehicle cigarette lighter adapter, a USB power cable, and a standard five-volt AC/DC adapter. The variety of power options ensures that you'll have a boosted signal whether you're driving in your car, traveling with your laptop, or working at your desk. Included with the booster kit is a convenient carrying case that fits neatly inside a briefcase, handbag, or suitcase.Once installed, the MobilePro can simultaneously support multiple cell phones and data cards. You'll experience fewer dropped calls, clearer call quality, and improved data rates--even with 3G technologies.Installing the MobileProInstallation is quick and easy; everything you need for installation in a building or car is included in the kit.In a BuildingTo install, simply attach the suction-cup window bracket to the inside of the window and place the magnet mount antenna on the bracket.
