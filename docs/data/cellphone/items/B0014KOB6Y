It significantly improves your cell phone's overall performance by minimizing dropped calls, increasing data rates, and letting you enjoy clearer reception, making the Wilson DT the ideal solution in an office or at home.DT Desktop Cell PhoneSignal BoosterAt a Glance:Boosts cell phone signal by more than 15x in your homeFewer dropped calls; faster data ratesEasy installation with mounting hardware includedSupports CDMA, TDMA, GSM and AMPS cell phone technologiesMade in the USAMultiple mounting options ensure you'll get the best possible signal.View larger.The Wilson Electronics Desktop (DT) cell phone signal Booster.View larger.It's All About PowerThe primary cause of dropped calls is low signal output power from the cell phone to the cell tower, which limits the phone's ability to communicate with the tower. A typical cell phone provides merely one-fifth of a watt of output power. To address this problem, the amplifier and the outside antenna work together to increase the phone's output power by more than 15 times over using just the phone alone.Enjoy Premium Reception and Fewer Dropped CallsIf you have to go to the window or outside to be able to use your cell phone, you know the frustration of weak cell phone signal reception. Using state-of-the-art technology, the Wilson DT amplifies the signal both to and from the cell tower, increasing the power to penetrate through natural or man-made obstructions, thus enabling you to communicate where you were unable to before.The Wilson DT comes with a compact signal booster that fits neatly on your desk or small table, and it works best when placed in the room where you're experiencing problems with reception.Included Hardware for Multiple Mounting OptionsThe Wilson DT is connected via a coaxial cable to the outside antenna, which performs best when mounted outside of the building and pointed towards the nearest cell tower. The antenna may also be mounted on a window (again, best when aimed at the nearest cell tower), or on an outside wall; however, some performance may be lost.Once installed, the Wilson DT enhances the signal of multiple cell phones and data cards near the device. The result is that you will experience fewer dropped calls, clearer call quality, and improved data rates--even with 3G technologies.Compatible with Most Cell Phone Models and ProvidersThe Wilson DT is compatible with all US and Canadian cellular providers, excluding iDEN, Nextel, and MIKE. Also, it supports CDMA, TDMA, GSM, and AMPS cell phone technologies, as well as data protocols such as GPRS, 1xRTT, HSDPA, EVDO, and EDGE. The use of radio distribution equipment that enhances, extends or amplifies a wireless signal may be prohibited without the consent of the wireless carrier upon whose network such equipment will be used. You should consult with your carrier before purchasing such equipment to use with that carrier&rsquo;s service.The Wilson DT Signal Booster includes a 30-day money-back guarantee and is backed by a one-year manufacturer's warranty.SpecificationsFrequency: 824-894 MHz / 1850-1990 MHzAmplifier Gain: 56dB / 56dBSystem Gain: 62dBMax Output Power: 1.3 wattsMax RF (downlink): +9.5dBmNoise Figure: 3.5dB nominalFlatness: &plusmn;5dBIsolation: > 90dBPower Requirements: 120-240V AC, 50-60 Hz, 8WConnectors: TNC Female / F-FemaleDimensions: 6.2 x 4.2 x 1.5 (inches)Weight: 0.64 lbsWhat's in the BoxIncludes everything you need for a full installation DT amplifier, on-board antenna, outside antenna, coaxial cables (20 feet and 30 feet), cable connector, wall bracket, mounting hardware for pole, wall or window mount, and AC power supply.The Wilson DT is ideal for improving you cell phone signal and data rates in a single room.Everything you need for better receptionis included in the box.View larger."}
