The package includes 2 Crystal Clear and 2 Anti-Glare Anti-Fingerprint Matte films. The Clear film offers the best clarity for high resolution screens, providing a distortion-free, viewing experience. The Matte film provides greater visibility in sunlight or under bright lights. The smooth matte finish reduces glare, the appearance of fingerprints, and provides easy glide touch with minimal friction.[ Installation Guide ]1. Start by choosing a brightly lit, dust-free environment and clean the screen thoroughly with provided microfiber cleaning cloth.Tip :Although no tools are necessary for application, residue-free invisible tape works great to pick up excess debris. After wiping with cleaning cloth, take a piece of tape and gently lift any dust particles that remain on the screen.2. Slowly peel away the film layer labeled \"Step 1\". Hold screen protector along the edges and avoid touching the film and screen surface.3. Before placing screen protector, carefully align the cutouts and edges to your screen and slowly lower screen protector starting from the bottom and working your way up.4. Gently sweep through the screen surface with the provided squeegee card. Push out any air bubbles towards the nearest edge.Tip :If you notice bubbling created by dust particles, you can use another piece of tape to gently lift the edges of the screen protector, one corner at a time, making sure not to bend excessively or crease the protector. Use a second piece of tape, carefully slide between the protector and your screen, and lift the remaining dust particles before laying the corner back down. Repeat step 4 as necessary.5. Finally, remove the film layer labeled \"Step 2\" and you are done!", "title": "Evecase Screen Protector Variety Pack with 2x Clear and 2x Matte Anti-Glare Film for Motorola DROID RAZR M, XT907 - 4 Pack (Verizon Version Compatible)", "price": 2.99, "salesRank": {"Cell Phones & Accessories": 142307}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51rkPdAcy8L._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B009KBH0TE", "B009K6XS4A", "B009K6X35Y", "B009K6UGAE", "B009SIFQAO", "B00A473G8M", "B009NW83K0", "B009K6UUFK", "B009JMP9BK", "B00A474FUK", "B009ON8MCW", "B00A6H7FK0", "B009TSVS9Q", "B00A6ZC26Y", "B009X260YQ", "B009TSVRIS", "B009M5LKYE", "B009LPU42O", "B009T75ZNC", "B009X25Z10", "B009SPDG04", "B009S7QWUS", "B009ISZLLS", "B009BBD8RG", "B00A475BJO", "B00ADI0SQU", "B009SPDH30", "B009X262TO", "B00ANQQFAK", "B009LQXZ1A", "B00AL1MIUS", "B009X261X6", "B009U1SXHW", "B009SPDG7W", "B00AOATF8O", "B009RQ1M5K", "B0097HGGWS", "B00ARBS40A", "B00ANQP6VE", "B00AK4VLPY", "B009IV1E52", "B00ADI0SLU", "B00ANEO6OY", "B00APR22PO", "B009SIJ28Q", "B00AL1NS2U", "B00AXZLCEK", "B009W5YHAI", "B0096QX6GY", "B00AI5N89W", "B0097HGFNS", "B00AL1PDXM", "B00A2HGP2S", "B009NW7EX2", "B00ATGCPP8", "B00AB68QRW", "B00A3JNCDU", "B006073P40", "B00ASP3O50", "B009TSVP0I", "B00ATGDAC0", "B00AKIHJL0", "B00AQ34KQ6", "B00AL1PNF0", "B009LPUYX8", "B0064UEZCE", "B00AA7M1E6", "B00AA2YIN8", "B00A475TQO", "B00AQ3ZBA0", "B00A472ELM", "B00B1XW39Q", "B00AOASWME", "B009PU6FSW", "B009JBGH3U", "B0060E7378", "B00CFDP2ZS", "B009SYQZH6", "B00A6OVKS6", "B00A2HGPU0", "B009CI1K4G", "B00B614OPO", "B009OKZ62O", "B00ARBRG2C", "B009SU3DX4"], "bought_together": ["B009KBH0TE"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B009LQXZ1A", "B009IV1DKI", "B00ANWVYQE", "B009IV1E52"]}}
