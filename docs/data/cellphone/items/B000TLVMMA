You get global coverage on 1 phone number.  It&#x2019;s easy to use because it uses standard direct dialing like your home phone (unlike the complicated call back system above).  And your service is continually active whenever you need it so you&#x2019;ll never get cut off.      And most importantly, you get the best call quality &#x2014; it automatically chooses the strongest cell phone signal of all the carriers in the area.  It&#x2019;s the equivalent of your US cell phone being able to choose between Cingular/AT&T;, Verizon, T-Mobile, Nextel and Sprint for the strongest signal every time you make a call, so the quality is always the best.    And quality is obviously the most important feature of a cell phone service!", "title": "Mobal GSM Global Roaming World SIM Card", "price": 9.99, "salesRank": {"Cell Phones & Accessories": 114799}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41YE0TaUyfL._SX300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B009IRGQPO", "B004GV13VY", "B002ZJ5EDC", "B004GV03JM", "B004003HAG", "B007I4GHFI", "B000YN01X4", "B00BIZT8A4", "B004XN0K7I"], "bought_together": ["B009IRGQPO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004GV13VY", "B009IRGQPO", "B004GV03JM", "B004UEA9DU"]}}
