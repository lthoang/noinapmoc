This mount package includes Arkon&#x2019;s Mega Grip one touch push-button holder and an air vent mount with swivel ball head. The universal design of the holder accommodates any smartphone having up to 3.25&#x201D; width with no height restrictions, making it compatible even when used with a large protective case or skin. The holder&#x2019;s unique side-grip technology provides a strong grip that&#x2019;s easy to use. Just set your phone in the mount and close the arms to lock in place. A push of the holder&#x2019;s side button releases the phone. The air vent mount clips onto any horizontal car air vent louvers, and a support leg rests on the bottom of the vent for added reinforcement. The swivel ball head of the air vent mount provides 360&#xB0; rotation, giving you the ultimate flexibility in viewing the smartphone from any angle. Garmin GPS devices can also be mounted to the car&#x2019;s air vent by simply unscrewing the swivel ball adapter and revealing the 17mm ball mount base. Replacement air vent clips are provided directly by Arkon under a limited lifetime warranty."}
