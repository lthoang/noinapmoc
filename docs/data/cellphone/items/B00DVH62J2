Standard ports only communicate effectively with particular devices, like Apple OR Android, often limiting their recharge rate. But with PowerIQ&#x2122; technology, two ports intelligently identify your device to speak its unique charging language. So plug in any brand or model and enjoy compatibility that doesn't limit your charging speed.The all-in-one charger.Three Standard charging ports charge most Android phones and iPhones with iOS 5 or later at full speed as well as many other devices. With five ports overall, you no longer have to choose between your devices or hunt for spare adapters.Compact and cable-chaos free.Create the perfect hub for your gear or the family's. About the size of a deck of playing cards, the charger fits nicely on a desk, nightstand, or countertop. Need to grab it and go? The unibody design slides easily into a bag or pocket.Safety first.Enjoy premium power but also peace of mind. Industrial-grade materials ensure reliability and durability, while fail-safes and regulators guard against shorts and surges. And for a little added safety, we had the design undergo strict testing to become UL Listed.For optimal use.Compatible with ALL phones, tablets and other USB-charged devices. The Asus Transformer and iPod Classic only charge in the Standard charging ports.To ensure complete safety and best performance, we strongly recommend using your device's original cable or a third-party certified cable (such as MFI).", "title": "Anker&reg; 25W 5-Port Desktop USB Charger with PowerIQTM Technology for iPhone 5s 5c 5; iPad Air mini; Galaxy S5 S4; Note 3 2; Tab; Nexus and More (White)", "price": 15.99, "salesRank": {"Cell Phones & Accessories": 288}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31jidMP2zlL._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B001FB6TUI", "B00D63QAGG", "B009CFMO0S", "B00IBDOB5I", "B009DCNP9O", "B00EQMPZJO", "B00G2USKZ4", "B00KMDDVDS", "B00HQY35SM", "B00GTGETFG", "B00B8L36A6", "B004GUS4WG", "B00EI8SS4U", "B00GANTT94", "B00K4VQZCM", "B00GN0AO34", "B00A9Z1UBO", "B00J9OH75Y", "B00KGQMJ9I", "B0092HWU7S", "B00D5T3QK4", "B005CKZNSM", "B00D82O68Y", "B00JA1XXCC", "B00C4Q61Z6", "B004GF8TIK", "B009USAJCC", "B00C28L5UW", "B00D3PGU94", "B00B3OA7R8", "B009G072WO", "B00IWA1MNE", "B00F2IY15K", "B00J5OTUOY", "B00IO9Y3AM", "B00DYWC0BI", "B00B8M4IMK", "B004SBBD8U", "B00K4KBWGC", "B004ZP74UK", "B00DGK9XWC", "B00GSNNWDA", "B005NF5NTK", "B00JL1490G", "B00FEZFJ5W", "B0097BEFYA", "B00JSNBDGU", "B00D5VAYRU", "B0084M696K", "B00BY6RH7I", "B002FFZGCU", "B00IL1DJCQ", "B00IMPM8OQ", "B0084OPT8C", "B0088U6OZY", "B00AB174ZW", "B00E7P7UHK", "B00IG9LSGM", "B009SYZ8OC", "B00CEZBKTO", "B007YLG14C", "B00FA4Y66U", "B00B5RGAWY", "B00H2RXPDS", "B00J46XO9U", "B00GODG3X0", "B00IVPU7KE", "B00JM59JPG", "B004SY5O5K", "B003ES5ZSW", "B003E48ERU", "B009N72TAA", "B00J39QGZC", "B002VPE1QG", "B0073FCPSK", "B00H9BEC8E", "B00EET7UHE", "B001TH7GUU", "B00AA6CS86", "B00JJ2C0S0", "B00AW2QT8I", "B001A5PDKQ"], "bought_together": ["B00GTGETFG"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00IBDOB5I", "B00GTGETFG", "B00GSNNWDA", "B00JJ2C0S0"]}}
