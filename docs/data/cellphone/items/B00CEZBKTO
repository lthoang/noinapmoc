Standard ports only communicate effectively with particular devices, like Apple OR Android, often limiting their recharge rate. But with PowerIQ&#x2122; technology, each port intelligently identifies your device to speak its unique charging language. So plug in any brand or model and enjoy compatibility that doesn't limit your charging speed.Packed with power.We figure, the more power, the better. Packed with 12000mAh of juice, and featuring an energy efficiency rate 10% above previous generation Astros and many current standard alternatives, the new Astro3 charges the iPhone six times and large-capacity phones like the Galaxy S4 almost four times.Double take.Chic and minimalistic, the new Astro3 may feel reserved at first. But, a friendly \"shake\" reveals its warm inner light to display the power level or begin your charge. Generous, cool, and delightfully intuitive, the new Astro3 is perfect for your next adventure, or just the daily grind.For optimal use.&#x2022; For simultaneous, max-speed charging of your Astro, check out Anker's 40W Wall Charger.&#x2022; Compatible with all Apple and Android smartphones, tablets (including the Nexus 7) and other USB-charged devices.
