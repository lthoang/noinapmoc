Built-in prongs allow the ZAGGsparq to double as a wall charger, and eliminates the need for an extra power adapter to keep your digital life running. The ZAGGsparq provides between 1 and 4 charges for a typical handheld device, and ZAGG's Hypercharge Technology on select ZAGGsparq models provides 2.1A output for ultra-fast charging, up to four times faster than a standard USB charger. An attractive, durable polycarbonate shell design allows the ZAGGsparq to maintain a glossy outer finish without gathering fingerprints or scratches. The soft-touch rubber underside allows the charger to fit comfortably in your hand. The ZAGGsparq features five LED lights to indicate power and charging levels, and a convenient on/off switch helps prevent battery drainage. Note: Some USB-charged devices use proprietary charging specifications. The ZAGGsparq has been designed to charge iOS devices and most Android smartphones and tablets. The ZAGGsparq is not compatible with the Nexus 7 tablet.", "title": "ZAGG ZSPARQ600SLV 6000 Silver Battery - Retail Packaging - Silver/Black", "price": 99.99, "salesRank": {"Cell Phones & Accessories": 22069}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31ENPP5pDPL._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B009K22S54", "B007EN890O", "B0084DVCNE", "B0052RVJDS", "B00J3LU1FG", "B002BFO490", "B0052RVJ0Q", "B0098FSOLK", "B0098FSKBO", "B007EN88ZK", "B0016L14U2", "B00343D2NC", "B00EXPSEFQ", "B0097BEFYA", "B005M9VYZY", "B0098FSOQK", "B00AI3RRAA", "B0055I183U", "B00A83I8G2", "B00B3ISAMS", "B00B3OA7R8", "B004LY59V6"], "bought_together": ["B0097BEFYA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B009K22S54", "B00AANQLRI", "B00D5T3QK4", "B005NGLTZQ"]}}
