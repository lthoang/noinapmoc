Signal loss however has always been a draw back until now. The Rokform Fuzion Aluminum iPhone case was designed with form and function in mind. While you will still receive the ultimate in protection you will not have to worry about any signal loss. This aluminum iPhone case does not require any tools or screws to take on/off while offering the sleekest of design profiles. Get all the protection without any bulk or signal loss.  The Rokform Rokbed Fuzion is CNC machined from 6061 T-6 aircraft grade aluminum and injection molded polycarbonate. The polycarbonate lower portion quickly snaps in and out of the aluminum but fits snug enough for a safe and secure protective fit. The new case is available in a variety of anodized colors to fit almost any taste. Compatible with all iPhone carriers. Designed, engineered and made in the USA."}
