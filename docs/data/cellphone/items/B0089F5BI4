Flexible, yet stronger and more durable than silicone, TPU offers excellent shock absorption and abrasion resistance while maintaining a thin form factor. The raised wrap-around edges make for a \"lay-on-the-table\" design that helps protect the glass screen from damage. Easy to install and remove, and definitely affordable--why not build a changeable wardrobe for your phone?*Please note*This case is designed to be used with the standard sized battery only.Regarding Screen Protector Sizing:Due to the tapered edge design of the Galaxy S III glass it was not possible to make our screen protector cover the glass all the way to the edge. Our screen protector covers the flat part of the glass only, as it would not adhere properly around the edges otherwise. This results in approximately 4mm of space from the edge of the display to the screen protector on all sides. This design choice will be consistent with the other static cling screen protectors on the market.Clear TPU will discolor over time when exposed to UV light. We do not replace cases due to discoloring.", "title": "Diztronic Clear GlitterFlex TPU Case &amp; Screen Protector for Samsung Galaxy S III - Retail Packaging", "price": 6.99, "salesRank": {"Cell Phones & Accessories": 146900}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/419pqNHmFUL._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0089FCLOQ", "B008WOVLE0", "B008FFW3W0", "B0089FA27E", "B0089F2ILM", "B0088LYCZC", "B008EME2BY", "B008EMZ9NO", "B008L73Y3Y", "B0088OJXE4", "B00849E1CM", "B008DJIJL2", "B00856XB70", "B0087PMTDG", "B008D66G8I", "B008EOXKTM", "B008ELGRCC", "B008EL5GA6", "B008HTJMY6", "B00C7YQG5A", "B008ATKOTK", "B00AECECGW", "B0087GAOE6", "B0089CH41O", "B00BV96VDY", "B009JT8IIO", "B007ZL0URU", "B00896EZB2", "B008DJIIG8", "B008DOBF04", "B0085BD0Z8", "B008589ZZU", "B008KKOGRA", "B008DJIGR4", "B00933CMZQ", "B00896956M", "B008ELG5V0", "B008AGA6PK", "B008IRBWUO", "B008HY7ECI", "B0085JRQZU", "B008D4PVRW", "B008H6386M", "B008A0WPR8", "B008HY7FBS", "B008VWUT8W", "B0092843LI", "B008D4XEEY"], "bought_together": ["B0089FCLOQ", "B0088LYCZC"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0089FCLOQ", "B0092843LI", "B009JT8IIO", "B008LFTCAK"]}}
