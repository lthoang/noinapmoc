We call it the Roadwarrior (TM) because some of our biggest fans are long-haul truckers. Unlike most over-the-ear headsets, the B250-XT features a professional grade, noise canceling microphone to effectively block out road and engine noise. High grade components ensure professional audio quality. If it works for an 18-wheeler driver, it'll certainly handle the road noise in the average car. An enhanced version of our popular B150 Wireless headset for Bluetooth enabled cellular phones and computers now with increased talk time: 10+ hours! Professional grade wireless Bluetooth headset for cellular phones and computers. Simply pair the headset to your Bluetooth enabled cellular phone or computer and you'll be handsfree and wirefree! The &#x201C;gooseneck&#x201D; microphone boom stays in place to ensure precise positioning. The concave ear cushion helps block out the sounds around you so you can hear your caller better. You also get an optional leatherette ear cushion, if you prefer that style. Say goodbye to wobbly over the-ear headsets! The over-the-head styling is stable, lightweight and comfortable. The ear cushion is slightly cupped for a better fit and the adjustable headband won&#x2019;t slip out of place. You'll get 16+ hours of talk time out of a full charge. Up to 150 hours standby time. Volume, mute, call answer/end buttons on headset. Includes both Auto (DC) and AC charging cords. 128-bit secure digital encryption for privacy."}
