It will not fit the Razr, Razr Maxx, Razr Maxx HD, or any other phones besides the Droid Maxx, originally released in August 2013.Please do not be alarmed if the retail packaging says \"Droid Razr Maxx Ultra\" as that was what we believed the Droid Maxx would be called at the time we printed the packaging. It will indeed fit the Droid Maxx.Slip your Motorola Droid Maxx into this custom fit Flexible TPU Case by Diztronic and experience the peace of mind of knowing your investment is well protected. Flexible, yet stronger and more durable than silicone, TPU offers excellent shock absorption and abrasion resistance while maintaining a thin form factor. The raised wrap-around edges make for a \"lay-on-the-table\" design that helps protect the glass screen from damage. Easy to install and remove, and definitely affordable--why not build a changeable wardrobe for your phone?Disclaimer:Diztronic cannot guarantee compatibility with OEM and 3rd party accessories, we can only guarantee compatibility with the actual phone and stock charging cable our cases were designed for.
