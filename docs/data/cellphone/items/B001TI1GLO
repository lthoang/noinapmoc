The base attaches to the windshield with a suction cup and continues with a flexible gooseneck that allows easy repositioning of the phone to get a better view. When youre not driving, we hope. Another thing you absolutely shouldnt do while driving is watch videos. But when youre stationary you can just rotate the bracket to place the iPhone in landscape position."}
