Light dances off the crisp, linear pattern of mathematical protection and perfection. This is a iPhone 4S case that will get you noticed. Founded in 2001, (with cases for the original iPod and the iSport, an iPod fanny pack with blinking lights) Speck has grown to become a worldwide leader in cases and bags for iPhone, MacBook, BlackBerry, iPad and tons of other personal electronic devices.

Speck makes the sort of fun, functional, stylish cases that they&#x2019;d want protecting their own gear&#x2014;or, for that matter, their kids' and grandparents' gear. From concept to design to finished product, Speck puts their hearts, smarts, and guts into everything they do. Their downtown Palo Alto, California headquarters is often messy, always bustling, and filled with a crew of dedicated (dare we say obsessed) folks who really know their stuff.
