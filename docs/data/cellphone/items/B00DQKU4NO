Take charge with Duracell Powermat. With the TravelMat you'll always have backup power -at home, the office, on the road, anywhere. It's the only two-in-one charger -a universal portable battery and wireless charger. Just drop, charge and go (wireless charging enabled device required and sold separately). It packs enough punch for not just your phone but also your tablet or other USB compatible device with an onboard high output USB. It's the ultimate travel companion. The TravelMat is part of the Duracell Powermat Wireless Charging Collection. Its compact design & flexibility make it perfect not just for travel or busy days on the go, but it can also do double duty as your wireless charging mat for home or office. The TravelMat features two ways to charge devices. Simply place wireless charging enabled devices on its surface to charge wirelessly. Or charge USB compatible devices such as tablets by connecting to the high output USB port (up to 2.1A) that is behind the copper tab. With its built-in high capacity battery, you can be truly untethered and enjoy drop-and-go charging or traditional backup battery charging anywhere, anytime. Check battery power at the touch of a button. Recharging is easy with the included power supply with detachable USB to micro USB charging cable. The TravelMat features the same intelligence as the PowerMat. When charging devices wirelessly, it senses the right amount of power to send and stops sending power when a device is fully charged. Power and brains -what could be better? Welcome to wireless charging! The smart, easy way to stay charged."}
