HSPA+ provides our fastest data speeds, up to 3 times faster than AT&T; and Verizon's standard 3G networks, while allowing simultaneous voice and data capabilities for the ultimate wireless voice and data experience.You'll enjoy 4G-like speeds with HSPA+ enabled areas, with a theoretical capability of up to 21 Mbps peak download speeds (and typical download speeds averaging between 5 and 8 Mbps).While T-Mobile doesn't currently offer mobile phones with HSPA+ compatibility, many 3G devices can benefit from enhanced speeds when they're on the HSPA+ network today--including the Samsung Vibrant.High-Speed Data Connectivity via T-Mobile's 3G NetworkIn addition to its quad-band GSM connectivity, this phone is also compatible with T-Mobile's UMTS/HSDPA 3G network, which operates on the 1700/2100 MHz AWS spectrum. This phone is designed to automatically connect to the best available network (3G or GSM/GPRS/EDGE) to provide faster data speeds when accessing the Web.In areas where the 3G network is not available, you'll continue to receive service on the via T-Mobile's EDGE network (which stands for \"Enhanced Data Rates for Global Evolution\"). This high-speed, mobile data and Internet access technology is fast enough to support a wide range of advanced data services (with average data speeds between 75-135Kbps), including full picture and video messaging, high-speed color Internet access, and e-mail on the go.While this phone is optimized for use with T-Mobile's high-speed 3G network, many of its functions will also work well on the moderate-speed EDGE network. If you plan to access the Internet extensively on your phone, 3G network coverage may serve you best.Activities that work well on EDGE or 3G networks:E-mail, instant messaging, and textingDownloading ringtones, CallerTunes, wallpaper, light data filesSending photographs via e-mail or picture messagingActivities that work best on a 3G network:Viewing content-heavy websites (lots of images or videos playing)Viewing YouTube and other video files (they will play on EDGE, but require loading time)Uploading large files (photos, videos, presentations) to sharing websitesDownloading large files from an e-mail or a websiteT-Mobile's 3G network is currently available in more than 220 cities nationwide and covers more than 160 million people.", "price": 119.55, "related": {"also_viewed": ["B004T0LKHO", "B007URA092", "B003V27PKM", "B00H50DVPE", "B006V47ONU", "B00387FAC0", "B003TLMQG8", "B00GOK6LEE", "B00E3UKHQU", "B0045JCCTY", "B005VIWMCU", "B002UV918O", "B004BNM86Q", "B0084S70Q2", "B00BNR5AWM", "B00COYOAYW", "B00607JBNO", "B008PF1YPW", "B00A29WCA0", "B00CMVLH66", "B001UBB9GM", "B00IYJ48HU", "B00GWR373M", "B009QZH49K", "B00BV1NKCW", "B00E45043A"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004T0LKHO", "B003ZNNC8G", "B00COYOAYW", "B00607JBNO"]}, "salesRank": {"Cell Phones & Accessories": 238219}, "categories": [["Cell Phones & Accessories", "Cell Phones", "Contract Cell Phones"]]}
