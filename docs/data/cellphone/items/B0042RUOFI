Based on testing, speed and accuracy are equal to or better than the traditional keyboard-tapping method. You can activate the Swype keyboard by pressing and holding in a text field, wait for popup to appear, click Input Method, and then select Swype.In the image to the left, the word \"quick\" was generated from tracing the path shown above in a fraction of a second, by roughly aiming to pass through the letters of the word. A key advantage to Swype is that there is no need to be very accurate, enabling very rapid text entry.Also Available for This Android DeviceAppstoreAmazon Appstore for AndroidGet a great paid app for free every day.KindleKindleBuy a book once and read it everywhere with our free Kindle Reading App for Android.MP3Amazon MP3Shop 15 million songs and stream your Cloud Drive music directly from your Android device.IMDBIMDBFind local movie showtimes and TV listings, watch trailers, and search the world's largest source of entertainment information.AudibleAudibleDownload audiobooks directly to your Android device, then listen wherever you go, get audiobook news, earn badges, and more.AMZN MobileAmazon MobileShop for millions of products, get product details, and read reviews--right from your mobile device.", "price": 399.99, "related": {"also_viewed": ["B004ZF0E16", "B00GXGZ2IU", "B0051PISK8", "B00E3UKHQU", "B007J5AAW2", "B004BNM86Q", "B00607JBNO", "B003S6KFKI", "B00H50DVPE", "B003V27PKM", "B0063VFTIS", "B00GOK6LEE", "B007ZSGR9S", "B006L9KG7Q", "B00EZW9UXW", "B007URA092", "B0057JAQXU", "B00940YUF8", "B00FCMFOFM", "B00295RBNI", "B00HQFOGSY", "B00F2SGBXK", "B004UHHPPC", "B004X6UENA", "B00B8Y852M", "B009UQIRWS", "B0053UCY24", "B00COYOAYW", "B004Z1V0WW", "B00ELMXYZQ", "B004T0LKHO", "B00IYJ48HU", "B00E89FFO0", "B00G8EZIJ0", "B00EJ61FGO", "B00BNR5AWM", "B004T36GCU", "B004Z7HYUI", "B005ISAMXY", "B00ELI8V3K", "B004XQJDVY", "B00GCGH8GA", "B008ZE7R1I", "B00GOK6LW6", "B0086ZV2M6", "B00AKG2XSQ", "B00HRUCTYG", "B00F9BFIMA", "B00K0NRVNG", "B00D9AOU3G"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004ZF0E16", "B0045EI356", "B003Z6Q1HM", "B004A80KXK"]}, "salesRank": {"Cell Phones & Accessories": 216381}, "categories": [["Cell Phones & Accessories", "Cell Phones", "Contract Cell Phones"], ["Sports & Outdoors", "Fan Shop", "Cell Phone Accessories"]]}
