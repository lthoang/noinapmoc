The inner layer includes a built-in screen protector that prevents scratches while memory foam pads cradle the device to provide added shock absorption. The outer silicone layer wraps around the inner layer to complete the case and also absorb impact. The Defender Series comes with a ratcheting belt-clip holster that can also double as a viewing stand."}
