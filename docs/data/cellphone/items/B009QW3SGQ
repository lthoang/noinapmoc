The tip of the Samsung&rsquo;s Galaxy S-Pen simulates a finger touch, tap or swipe to provide a full touch-screen environment without leaving a single fingerprint behind. With its attractive design, the S-Pen allows you to make quick notes, draw or edit in addition to performing typical touch-screen commands. You can also use the Replacement Stylus&rsquo; multifunction button in conjunction with shortcut gestures for faster input. The Samsung Galaxy S-Pen with Eraser for Galaxy Note 2 takes things to a whole new level with its quickness and ease of making corrections to your work!Precision and ControlThe Samsung Galaxy Note S-Pen with Eraser is made to compliment your Galaxy Note 2 smartphone.

Its small and lightweight design makes it easy and accurate to control giving you complete precision over your handset. Finished in an attractive black, the S-Pen with Eraser is styled similarly to a premium-writing instrument, yet it&rsquo;s small enough to completely fit into the Galaxy Note 2 handset.Expanding on greatnessSimilar to the original S-Pen for the Galaxy Note 2, this device features an eraser built into the opposite end of the stylus. The built-in eraser, which functions similarly to selecting the eraser tool with the S-Pen, offers a convenient shortcut for switching between the pen or paintbrush tool and the eraser for quick corrections.Don&rsquo;t get stuck without oneWhile you can set your Note 2 to alert you if you leave your S-Pen behind, a stylus is small and easy to misplace. So whether you are replacing one, or just want to have a spare on hand, the Samsung Galaxy S-Pen with Eraser will ensure that you&rsquo;re never without your trusty S-Pen.Compatibility:Galaxy Note, Galaxy Note II and Galaxy Note 10.1Product Highlights:&#x25CF; Full-featured S Pen with button for gesture control plus eraser tip for easy correction&#x25CF; Capacitive stylus boasts a smudge-free, silicone tip for pinpoint accuracy and no fingerprints.&#x25CF; Attractive black finish&#x25CF; Compatible with Galaxy Note, Note II and Note 10.1About the ManufacturerSamsung Electronics Corporation researches, develops and markets a variety of personal and business communications products including mobile phones, tablets and associated accessories.
