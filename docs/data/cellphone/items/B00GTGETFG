Say hello to all-in-one charging convenience.\n\nWith an industry-leading 40 watt output among 5 ports, charge any combination of power-\nhungry phones, tablets or other USB-charged devices simultaneously.Compact and cable-chaos free.Create the perfect hub for your gear or the family's. About the size of a deck of playing cards,\n\nthe charger fits nicely on a desk, nightstand, or countertop. Need to grab it and go? The unibody\n\ndesign slides easily into a bag or pocket.Powerful yet safe.With top-grade microchips and built-in fail-safes, you don't just get full power but full safety too.\n\nWe've also incorporated a port-level circuit protection system that shuts off the charger in the\n\nevent of overvoltage, overcurrent, overheating or short circuits.For optimal use.ALL phones, tablets and other USB-charged devices (except the Asus Transformer and iPod Classic).To ensure complete safety and best performance, we strongly recommend using your device's original cable or a third-party certified cable (such as MFI)."}
