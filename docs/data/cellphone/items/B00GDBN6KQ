More light, less shake. The advanced new lens on Nexus 5 captures more light for brighter night and sharper action shots. And with optical image stabilization, you can stop worrying about shaky hands and blurry pictures. Better colors by day, less noise at night. The new HDR+ mode automatically snaps a rapid burst of photos and combines them to give you the best possible shot. Daytime shots are vivid with clean shadows, and night time shots are sharp with less noise. Capture more of your big moments. Real life doesn't fit in 4\" x 6\", so Nexus 5 comes with Photo Sphere. Create the effect of an immersive 360 view that no traditional camera can match. When you capture the full scene, you share the full story. Speed and power to spare on a stunning 5\" display. Slimmer, lighter design. Nexus 5 is precision-built from strong materials, and the intelligently simple design showcases more of what matters to you. At only 4.59 oz and 8.59 mm thin, it's the most powerful Nexus phone yet. Speed and power to spare. With 4G/LTE and ultra-fast Wi-Fi, Nexus 5 keeps you connected at blazing speeds. Add in the cutting-edge 2.26GHz Qualcomm SnapdragonTM 800 processor and you'll race through games, zip around the web and switch between apps at the flick of a finger. Stunning 5\" display. More room to do what you do, and better colors too. Nexus 5 gives you a Full HD display so you can see every detail in lifelike color with less glare and a wider viewing angle-the perfect canvas for your moments. Powered by Android 4.4, KitKat. Android is fast and powerful yet simple to use. From the home screen, say \"Ok Google\" to start a voice search, get directions or play a song. Focus on getting stuff done without having to think about the technology underneath."}
