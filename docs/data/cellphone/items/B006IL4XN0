Super easy setup. No attachments stuck onto your device.  You can likely use your current protective case, or no case at all - the choice is yours. When you upgrade your device, the Dockem will likely work with the new one too. Use without removing your Smart Cover. It's simple, clean, effective, and affordable.Package includes:2 ABS plastic brackets, 2 large Command strips, cleaning pads, and instructions.How it works:The Dockem utilizes 2 brackets placed individually to fit your device. The sleek design allows you to easily dock and undock your device. It utilizes Command adhesive strips to provide a simple, safe, and convenient way to store your device on any smooth vertical surface. Devices can be charged while docked, and there is a convenient built in cord clip at the bottom of each bracket. The strips are rated to hold up to 5 lbs each. When it comes time to remove the brackets, the Command strips stretch off leaving no damage or residue on the wall.Compatibility:The Dockem is compatible with most devices less than 20mm thick. Some compatible devices include: iPad 1, iPad 2, New iPad 3, all iPhones, Droid Razr phones, Droid 1,2,3, & 4, LG Spectrum, Galaxy Nexus, Samsung Galaxy Tab, Acer Iconia, ASUS Transformer EEE Pad, Transformer Prime, HTC Flyer, Amazon eReaders & Tablets, iPods, Blackberry, Playbook, Galaxy Note, Galaxy S 2/3, HTC smartphones, Toshiba Thrive, Sony Tablet S, Coby Kyros, Motorola Xoom, Nook, Archos, ePad, Le Pan, and many more.PLEASE NOTE:While the Dockem is compatible with a wide variety of devices, it is not adjustable once setup without removing and applying a new set of Command Strips. Additionally, it is not designed to \"grip\" your device in any way. It uses clever engineering to create a miniature \"shelf\" with an upper arm. Devices simply rest in the pocket created, and therefore it's not meant to be used on moving surfaces.", "title": "Dockem White: Damage-Free Smartphone, Tablet, &amp; eReader Wall Mount &amp; Dock (iPhone, iPhone 4, 4S, 5, Android phones, New iPad 3, iPad 2, iPad 1, Samsung Galaxy S II S2, HTC Vivid, Blackberry, Nexus, LG Optimus, Sony Xperia, Galaxy Note, Droid Razr Maxx, iPod Touch)", "price": 9.99, "salesRank": {"Cell Phones & Accessories": 17057}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31uKCEzO-EL._SX300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B004Z88WSK", "B00BWDGCM4", "B008E0Q0C0", "B006ILK13Q", "B00I4A9N0Q", "B007FTGF8A", "B0084M69YW", "B00797A7NW", "B0058SRNZY", "B00CPCL7JO", "B000FCGS5Y", "B00GDJYAT4", "B003HZPKSM", "B00B0N88LO", "B00B1GHC58", "B007FTGHII", "B008O11IEY", "B0084M68IO", "B0084M696K", "B004K2YBQI", "B00B3OA7R8", "B00A7O4TN8", "B0092HOHU6", "B00824948U", "B00FS4AF0S", "B00J1R0XGY", "B000F9LRXA", "B00IU6R2AW", "B00193U3O0", "B00F3TSH7Q", "B003S7V5U6", "B004K2WZS4", "B009SYZ8OC", "B00FA4Y66U"], "bought_together": ["B004Z88WSK", "B008E0Q0C0"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004Z88WSK", "B00I4A9N0Q", "B007FTGF8A", "B006ILK13Q"]}}
