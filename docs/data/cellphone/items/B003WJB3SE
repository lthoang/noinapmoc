The universal design of the holder accommodates any smartphone having up to 3.25&#x201D; width with no height restrictions, making it compatible even when used with a large protective case or skin. Moreover, the holder&#x2019;s design keeps cameras free for spontaneous photos or videos. This mount package includes Arkon&#x2019;s Mega Grip one touch push-button holder, the Travelmount deluxe mini windshield suction car mount, and a circular 3M adhesive dashboard mounting disk. The holder&#x2019;s unique side-grip technology provides a strong hold that&#x2019;s easy to use. Just set your phone in the mount and close the arms to lock in place. A push of the holder&#x2019;s side button releases the phone. The arm of the windshield suction mount adjusts vertically and provides 360&#xB0; rotation, giving you the ultimate flexibility in viewing the smartphone from any angle. If using a large, ruggedized case with the Samsung Galaxy Mega, Galaxy Note 3, and Galaxy Note 2, Arkon recommends the new Slim-Grip Ultra Model SM614 (also available on Amazon)."}
