Comfortable, stylish, and intelligently designed, the HS820 frees you up to multitask and talk whenever, and wherever you please.Simply turn on the headset to establish a reliable wireless connection to a compatible phone up to 32.8 feet away. The headset's Bluetooth 1.2 compatibility means that you'll enjoy faster connections, better audio quality, adaptive frequency hopping and improved interference rejection (don't worry, it's also compatible with the older Bluetooth 1.1 specification). With up to six hours of talk time, you can converse to your heart's content before you'll need to charge the HS820's internal battery. The headset also has up to 100 hours of standby time, so you're always ready to receive a handsfree call.No matter how fancy or powerful a headset may be, it's not all that useful if it isn't comfortable. Fortunately, the HS820 has comfort covered. The earhook is designed to work on your left or right ear, while an intuitive function menu and comfortable buttons make everyday use a breeze. There's also an LED light indicator that shows the status of the headset, including notification of pairing mode, pairing successful, power state, charge state and call state. Call management features --such as voice dialing, last number dial, conference calling and hold-- are available right from the headset, so you can leave your phone in your pocket, in your briefcase, or across the room. All of this is rolled up into a package that weighs less than .8 ounces.Compatibility:Motorola A630, RAZR V3, V505, V551, V600 and V710 Phones, and all other Bluetooth 1.1 or 1.2 compliant devices.What's in the BoxMotorola HS820 Bluetooth headset, charger, user's manual, quick start guide.", "title": "Motorola HS820 Bluetooth Headset - Hematite Gray", "price": 54.09, "salesRank": {"Cell Phones & Accessories": 169499}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/415XVMDVG2L._SX300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0006HTZ80", "B0049VQTSS", "B003VSS2AI", "B00158M7ZW", "B001AVR8IK", "B0025V1NVM", "B00DUTIZJG", "B004ESMGEM", "B004CU1VW0", "B000ARU12A", "B0013AB80C", "B003KS7KKM", "B004FOM9O2", "B000EM0WGG", "B0030C4K8I", "B001AVNMLW"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B004CU1VW0", "B0006HTZ80", "B0049VQTSS", "B004FOM9O2"]}}
