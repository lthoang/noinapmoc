You can also check the headset's battery level from your iPhone, or use the free MyHeadset app to display the battery meter on your Android smartphone. Offering a balanced, comfortable design, the Voyager Legend has a 25 percent smaller body size (compared to the Voyager PRO HD) and features up to 7 hours of talk time.Simply Intuitive:Making and receiving calls is simple with Smart Sensor technology, which intuitively directs calls to your phone or headset and allows you to automatically answer by simply placing the headset on your ear--no buttons to press or applications to open. If you're already wearing it, the Voyager Legend announces who's calling and waits for you to say \"Answer\" or \"Ignore\" (an ignored call is sent straight to voicemail).Astounding Audio:Offering a high level of audio quality, the Voyager Legend enables you to roam into any environment with the confidence that every word will be heard clearly. The Voyager Legend's precision-tuned triple microphones separate your speech from up to 80dB's of background noise while enhanced Windsmart technology provides three layers of wind protection for clear calls regardless of your environment. The enhanced Digital Signal Processing (DSP) provides a more natural voice sound, while the wideband audio with noise cancellation capabilities enable clearer conversations over PC telephony. Finally, SoundGuard technology ensures listening comfort and acoustic limiting for protection against audio spikes.More than just taking calls on your mobile phone or tablet, the Voyager Legend also includes the A2DP Bluetooth profile, enabling you to stream music, podcasts, GPS directions, and other audio."}
