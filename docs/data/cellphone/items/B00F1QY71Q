Our engineer was able to make it so thin and so hard that it is hardly noticeable on the phone, yet providing the protection your phone screen deserves.When it is installed on your phone, there is no gap in between the screen and the protector, which ensures the least interference with the touch response. The high quality silicon adhesive layer on the screen protector makes it super easy to apply. It also has an oleo phobic coating that prevents fingerprints and other contaminants and makes the film easy to clean. When being impacted, it breaks into small pieces that are not sharp and contained in the film.VERY IMPORTANT TIPS:1. Before you install the screen protector, please make sure you clean up the screen thoroughly with the microfiber cloth and sticker included in the package. It is very very very important that there is no grease, dust or any small particles on the screen.2. When you try to apply the screen protector on the screen, never never and never touch the sticky side of the screen protector.3. Most important - Please try to feel the edges of the iPhone and you can feel the plastic edges around the phone (in between the aluminum and screen) raise up a little bit. Your Screen Protector should be placed within the raised plastic edges. You can line up with the edge on one side first and then place it down carefully. If the screen protector goes over the raised edge, it will not stick to the screen perfectly. It will still work and look ok, just won't be perfect. So, please be very careful when you install the screen protector.", "title": "Bear Motion Premium Tempered Glass Screen Protector for iPhone 5S / iPhone 5C / iPhone 5 (0.2 mm)", "price": 14.99, "salesRank": {"Cell Phones & Accessories": 49459}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/418vYdn-SLL._SX300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00CZE3HY0", "B00HMCHUCU", "B00BT8L2MW", "B00GW5VRO0", "B00EVEOXTU", "B00ECHR1TU", "B00DMKGSOW", "B00EWFEYGU", "B00EUETNQO", "B00DMKGR66", "B00D12GEFO", "B00A9LVC2K", "B00FFM7UKG", "B00G0KD3OO", "B00GX230EW", "B00E4KP4W6", "B00ECHR2M6", "B00DMKGPP4", "B00J8ZJCUW", "B00ENMZURO", "B00J8ZJBCQ", "B00E4JZLNE", "B00FEWLKO4", "B00FEDV1HO", "B00BL5FBFW", "B00CTVJGKI", "B00J1VXI0I", "B00EOO1RHS", "B00GOMTQOO", "B00CZ59UZ4", "B00D94RCV4", "B00FFM7TBG", "B00GWRVU4K", "B00D94RG5G", "B00AAOWYHI", "B00E486Q9I", "B00DRJTY44", "B00ENMZV6E", "B00FHNCGFW", "B00BT8KZCU", "B00CUUKPMG", "B00DVPEXYA", "B00HVRJ2ZO", "B008RBI8L2", "B00F2RTAL6", "B00FLFSTGG", "B00CY4WHZ6", "B00GPAFP7W", "B00G3JCFNC", "B00CMHRTSA", "B00HBFSCD4", "B00H0ADLR2", "B00IZGOKOS", "B00D94RE08", "B00ABDJ3YU", "B00FLCQIQW", "B009YCP1LS", "B00DVPEWUU", "B00B3OA7R8", "B001NOVF92", "B00BL5FDFK", "B00G1HBDGG", "B00FHI6GVM", "B0097BEFYA", "B00GSPCRN4", "B00974L1T4", "B00EV5Z7YY", "B00FA9DMDS", "B00974L4GE", "B00DRJWMVG", "B00G00QBUW"], "bought_together": ["B00A9LVC2K"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00HMCHUCU", "B00BT8L2MW", "B00CZE3HY0", "B00EOO1RHS"]}}
