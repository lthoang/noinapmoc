{"asin": "B00GCFSLFS", "categories": [["Cell Phones & Accessories", "Accessories", "Data Cables"]], "description": "Extra LengthThis cable is over 9.8 feet long, giving you that precious extra length to reach wherever you need.  Great for places where your outlet is simply too far away for a normal cable to be convenient.No More Fumbling For your Cable in the Dark:While this lighted cable is fun to use anywhere, where it truly shines is in the bedroom.  With its brightly glowing head, this cable allows you to turn the lights out before you hop into bed without worrying about fumbling for your charger to plug in your device for the night. The small LED light in the head of the cable will help you find the cable easily, and will also help you find the port on your device.PLEASE NOTE:Please be aware that the LED does not turn off unless unplugged, so if you are sensitive to light while sleeping, you will need to put the cable out of sight or covered.  It is rather bright in a dark room.Lose the Tangles:To top things off, this cable features a flat cable design, meaning far less tangles and knots in your cord than your typical round cable.Perfect For Use with the Dockem Smartphone and Tablet Wall Mount:With your cord safely stored in the Dockem cord holder, the light up head makes it super easy to find your dock in the dark, and also super easy to find the charging port on your device.Note:This cable features a small Dockem \"(0)\" logo on the full USB end.  If you receive a cable without the logo - you have received a knock-off and should contact Amazon or Dockem immediately.", "title": "9.8 ft LED Light Up Micro USB Cable - Extra Long 3 meter (9.8 ft) Universal Charging Cord with Flat Tangle Free Noodle Ribbon style, White LED Lighted Head Cable for Android/Windows Smartphones and Tablets (Samsung, Motorola, Microsoft, Nokia, HTC, Droid, Blackberry, ASUS, Google, Acer, HP, Galaxy) DCKM341", "price": 7.99, "salesRank": {"Cell Phones & Accessories": 3787}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4113eLtwSNL._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00FSKL40W", "B00KXCEWKY", "B00KXCEWL8", "B00EI3YK5G", "B00FAADBHO", "B00HZXYYQ6", "B00FAAGNLU", "B00HG1BJAG", "B00HHZ93DG", "B00HG1BJCO", "B00CTUIT20", "B00IZOU1KM", "B00AQA7RG4", "B00H7HLEZY", "B00BWLWKT0", "B00EVX9GJI", "B00E0M55QI", "B00HPTU00E", "B00HHGRXZ0", "B00JZHE3PM", "B00G5K3B46", "B00HPTU0OU", "B00DYWC0BI", "B00ICHR740", "B00FW1GE9S", "B00EI8SS4U", "B00D2OLUZ0", "B00JZHE3R0", "B00IO5LRYQ", "B0073FCPSK", "B00G5LILOU", "B00HNF0Q54", "B00GTGETFG", "B00E0M55PE", "B00G5LILDQ", "B00KL806PK", "B004OGXY72", "B004GF8TIK", "B00C7T78H0", "B00DRDZ08E", "B00FZLMIZE", "B00FEZFJ5W", "B003YKX6WC", "B00JPZE9EY", "B00GS9CLO0", "B00FZLMJJO", "B00IBDOB5I", "B00BOM4ZZO", "B00C0ZKI9Q", "B00GB8XIZO", "B009RXU59C", "B00GNIFUB2", "B00BJN74OM", "B00K33N3GC", "B0073FE1F0", "B00F3J2KJW", "B00DYWC26G", "B00C28L6EW", "B00BNQTIRQ", "B00JQ2IXD4", "B00ISGCAJM", "B003ES5ZSW", "B00HX3G6J6", "B00H7HJZFA", "B00IWA1MNE", "B001TH7GUU", "B00EHIPQ1E", "B00H2FK7O0", "B00B8L36A6", "B005LFXBJG", "B00DQMHM14", "B000S5Q9CA", "B00HWG8XIQ", "B00D3PGU94", "B008EQYRRY", "B009QZH7BU", "B005CG2ATQ", "B00ATZJ606", "B00DVH62J2", "B001TH7GUK"], "bought_together": ["B00FAADBHO"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00KXCEWKY", "B00KXCEWL8", "B00CTUIT20", "B00JZHE3PM"]}}
