Quite frankly, these cables are the best manufactured product you will find. Apple MFI Certified All iSmooth Cables are MFI certified by Apple to meet Apple performance standards and carry the Made for iPhone, Made for iPad and Made for iPod logos. Don't compromise performance, risk potential damage to your Apple device, or violate your product warranty by using non-certified cables. What is MFI Certified? MFI (\"Made for iPhone/iPod/iPad\") is Apple's product licensing program for developers of hardware and peripherals for Apple's iPod, iPad and iPhone. Apple tests and certifies products from these developers to guarantee complete compatibility and functionality with Apple devices. Why is MFI Certification important to me? Non-MFI products are not tested and could be incompatible with your iDevice. This simply means the cable will not fully charge or your iPhone, iPad or iPod and could short out, stop functioning and damage your device. Every time there is an iOS update (almost monthly), non-MFi certified cables become incompatible and obsolete. iSmooth' s Hassle-Free 10 Year Warranty Please contact us if your cable does not meet your expectations, as we want you to be 100% satisfied with your purchase from iSmooth."}
