The tripod is also compatible with small digital cameras with the standard 1/4&#x201D;-20 camera pattern, including the Sony Action Cam, Sony POV HD Flash Memory Camcorder, Contour ROAM2, JVC ADIXXION, and JVCADIXXION Cam 2. This unique package includes Arkon&#x2019;s Mobile Grip 2 Universal Smartphone Holder and the Flexible Mini Tripod with handy carrying pouch. Use the flexible mini tripod/holder package in one of two ways: 1) Attach a digital camera directly to the flexible mini tripod by screwing it onto the 1/4&#x201D;-20 mounting bolt, or 2) screw the end of the Mobile Grip 2 holder directly onto the mini tripod for use with a smartphone (remove the rubber insert on the side of the holder to reveal an industry-standard 1/4&#x201D;-20 threaded camera mounting pattern for use). Take photos anywhere using the Flexible Mini Tripod. Bend the tripod&#x2019;s legs to grab on to fences, poles, and trees. Or, hold up the tripod to get a better shot of the action at concerts, parades, and other public events. The Mobile Grip 2 holder expands to accommodate all smartphones (even those with skins and ruggedized cases) up to 3.6&#x201D; wide. The holder is just 1.4&#x201D; high, and is ideal for those who prefer a smaller profile. The holder&#x2019;s spring-loaded mechanism makes it easy to insert or remove the cell phone from the holder with one hand, yet holds the smartphone securely. Its simplistic yet effective design keeps rear smartphone cameras free for spontaneous pictures or videos."}
