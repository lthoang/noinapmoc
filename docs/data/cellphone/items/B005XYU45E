Simple layouts with subtle animations and delightful flourishes make everything feel alive. Gone are lists of text with icons, replaced by big pictures and bold text, just like a magazine. Instead of boring button presses, find your way around with fun, consistent gestures. The home screen, web browser, email and everything in between have been rethought and redesigned to make Android simple, beautiful, and beyond smart. Widgets galore: Interact with your favorite apps right from your home screen with new types of widgets. Resize and arrange them to suit yourself. Multi-task away: Quickly switch between apps with a dedicated recent apps button. Dismiss those you don't care about with a swipe of your finger. Keep me notified: Swipe down to see your latest notifications, now with rich graphics and controls. Swipe your finger to dismiss those you don't need. Type with your voice: Galaxy Nexus listens. Simply touch the microphone on the keyboard and start talking to write emails, SMS, or any other text-more than 20 languages supported. Text appears in real time, so there&#x2019;s no waiting for server processing.", "title": "Samsung GT-i9250 Galaxy Nexus Unlocked Smartphone with Android OS 4.0, 16 GB Memory, Touchscreen, 5 MP Camera, Wi-Fi, and Dual-Core Processor--No Warranty (Titanium Silver)", "price": 8.99, "salesRank": {"Cell Phones & Accessories": 88074}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41DzN1TV2ML._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0065PGWQ0", "B007NMJM66", "B005ZEF01A", "B006WJ1L9W", "B006VTMUS4", "B007TCA5MU", "B005XQGBE0", "B007HI5NXW", "B005OTKTMQ", "B0062V037Q", "B00678NP5Q", "B007939RIM", "B004USPRM4", "B006PAMXNG", "B00712QO8C", "B006WJ1L06", "B007NMN906", "B006MKLHDG", "B007VCRRNS", "B00A9ZER46", "B008DD485E", "B00634HFWS", "B00FOKOOOY", "B0080MCVMK", "B00ABPKHH0", "B0085TWHXQ", "B007ENEOSK", "B007870GVG", "B007O437D2", "B006MKILOO", "B0029RVHRM", "B00GDBN6KQ", "B00FOKOOQM", "B0065VZHZQ", "B006E7UTFO", "B008B5DU44", "B009LZ38QI", "B00DB3SH2G", "B006JO232E", "B006SBR5TO", "B006H5O9AY", "B0099LATZ2", "B009PLBLQC", "B004XIE6WI", "B00GWR373M", "B00DTSGW0W", "B007VXJR4Y", "B0078LXM40", "B006D8NTXI", "B006MQEPW0", "B008SAS22M", "B00812YWXU", "B00CX0G5B8", "B00A29WCA0", "B00GWR36F6", "B00BV1NKCW", "B008DCXVN0", "B007NMW1SM", "B006YYX9B8", "B008V7ENVQ", "B00CMVLH66", "B004QTBQ2C", "B0053HSZQG", "B00ACVHKSC", "B00BV1MVJ0", "B004T0LKHO", "B00D94OAPU", "B006MKJHYM", "B005M3518G", "B006OTF25Y", "B009LZNM3M", "B006L9G20Q", "B00923G46U", "B0078LXM4A", "B0067I0A04", "B00FCMFOFM", "B0085BCC1G", "B0067HQL30", "B00BU3H0C2", "B004HHJWEW", "B00DVFLJDS", "B00GG63522", "B006CVO2AU", "B0083HHU5A", "B0061YRDX6", "B004OORO9I", "B006MK2E8S", "B0077IQ1FQ", "B006V2EDJ0", "B00A6MEP8A", "B00746GV06", "B00H0MGCDK"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B005ZEF01A", "B0065PGWQ0", "B00GWR373M", "B007Q4Z1NE"]}}
