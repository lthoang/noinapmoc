Keeping an extra battery, charged and handy, is a good plan anytime. Long flights and longer meetings, power blackouts and transit snarls - an extra battery gives you the power to keep on communicating, come what may. Only genuine BlackBerry&#xAE; smartphone batteries work best with your device, holding their charge longer and taking the maximum number of charges over their lifetime. That's why your battery features a cryptographic chip to assure you it's genuine. Flight delays, power outages, extended trips. You can't always recharge your BlackBerry device when you'd like to. But with an extra battery on hand, you can always talk, type and work as long as you need to. Keep it in your bag or briefcase and you'll stay connected, powered up and ready to get the job done."}
