It will look best on the white version of the phone. On the pebble blue model it will look different than the above pictures.Slip your Galaxy S III into this custom fit Matte Back Clear TPU Case by Diztronic and experience the peace of mind of knowing your investment is well protected. Flexible, yet stronger and more durable than silicone, TPU offers excellent shock absorption and abrasion resistance while maintaining a thin form factor. The raised wrap-around edges make for a \"lay-on-the-table\" design that helps protect the glass screen from damage. Easy to install and remove, and definitely affordable--why not build a changeable wardrobe for your phone?**Please note**Our case is designed to be used with the standard sized battery only.Regarding color changing:We have added an anti-yellowing agent to our clear TPU todelaythe yellowing that is common with clear plastic exposed to UV light over time. How long the case takes to yellow depends largely on how often it's exposed to UV light. In addition, this case does have a matte finish, so it can be difficult to clean. If you frequently slide your phone into blue jeans pockets for example, it may pick up some of the blue dye from the fabric. Please keep in mind that you may need to replace this case more frequently than our other colors.We will not replace this case due to discoloringRegarding Screen Protector Sizing:Due to the tapered edge design of the Galaxy S III glass it was not possible to make our screen protector cover the glass all the way to the edge. Our screen protector covers the flat part of the glass only, as it would not adhere properly around the edges otherwise. This results in approximately 4mm of space from the edge of the display to the screen protector on all sides.", "title": "Diztronic Matte Back Clear Flexible TPU Case &amp; Screen Protector for Samsung Galaxy S III (Sprint, AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, US Cellular, Verizon) [Diztronic Retail Packaging]", "price": 8.95, "salesRank": {"Cell Phones & Accessories": 104665}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21eBoMEE4CL._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B0089F2ILM", "B008FFW3W0", "B0089FA27E", "B0089F5BI4", "B0085GI1S4", "B00849E1CM", "B0089FCLOQ", "B0087GAOE6", "B0088LYCZC", "B008DOBF04", "B0085BD0Z8", "B0084F4HY8", "B0082PH1MK", "B008ASX5DS", "B0082P8K6G", "B008DJIJL2", "B008HTJMY6", "B0088OJXE4", "B008ATCSBC", "B008WOVLE0", "B0089E4050", "B00887FJWG", "B008AGA6PK", "B008BUTJ3A", "B0085YEA90", "B0085JRQFU", "B007WTAJTO", "B0089VO7RY", "B007XZM6VG", "B008DKC2UU", "B007VOM0R4", "B0080CXR6O", "B00BV96VDY", "B00845NI8E", "B008969LJI", "B008589ZZU", "B0088A3PAG", "B0097MVKW4", "B0087GANO2", "B000S5Q9CA", "B008AFSSRE", "B008DO84M6", "B00872TKJA", "B008G1FFBO", "B00805SFBI", "B007KFXIDE", "B008DO64WI", "B00AECECGW", "B0089NQF22", "B00A55Q2HA", "B0065PGWQ0", "B0089CH3TM", "B005TUQV0E", "B0097EUVVI", "B008KKOGRA", "B008SFI9WU", "B005YEFM8M", "B008ASZ4KU", "B008ACETBQ", "B008EPW1MI", "B008BVIV06", "B0085U7P2I", "B00894K248", "B00891PTQM", "B0085DZ5F4", "B0089VO7OM", "B007FHX9OK", "B0087GAMUC", "B008DO5EKG", "B008AT7PYW", "B0089VO7QU", "B0089VO71U", "B008EME2BY", "B0049XVN6E", "B0084YZSQK", "B0085RGY9Q", "B00771G040", "B0080CXSOU", "B007JWWKMI", "B001XXUOQI", "B00ECDL5AK", "B0089KJW3Y", "B009QZH7BU", "B00812YWXU", "B00DR0PDNE", "B00829O8S6", "B005FUNYSA"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B0089F2ILM", "B0087GAOE6", "B008FFW3W0", "B0088LYCZC"]}}
