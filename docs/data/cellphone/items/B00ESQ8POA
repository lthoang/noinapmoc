You can use the extra power during the day to keep you going until night-time charging, on your plane ride to avoid getting bored with in-flight entertainment, while camping, on a road trip, business trip, or any other occasion where having some more power can make the difference between enjoying your iPhone and a blank screen = boredom.The case comes in black and white color variations to match different tastes, and comes with two bumper colors: one to match the color of the case, and a pink one included in the packaging for those who would like their phone to stand out!Unlike most battery cases in its category, the BX112 comes with a lightning USB port instead of the standard microUSB (charging cable not included). This charging port can be used to charge your iPhone and the case at the same time using any standard USB wall charger (not included) or your PC/Laptop USB port. When connected to a USB power outlet, simply press the power button on your battery case and watch your iPhone charge/sync first and then the battery case will charge.The case has a built-in overcharge protection, which turns the battery charging function off when your phone battery reaches 100%.
