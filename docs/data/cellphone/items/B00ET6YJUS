It will indeed fit the Droid Mini.Slip your Motorola Droid Mini into this custom fit Flexible TPU Case by Diztronic and experience the peace of mind of knowing your investment is well protected. Flexible, yet stronger and more durable than silicone, TPU offers excellent shock absorption and abrasion resistance while maintaining a thin form factor.

Easy to install and remove, and definitely affordable--why not build a changeable wardrobe for your phone?Disclaimer:Diztronic cannot guarantee compatibility with OEM and 3rd party accessories, we can only guarantee compatibility with the actual phone and stock charging cable our cases were designed for.
