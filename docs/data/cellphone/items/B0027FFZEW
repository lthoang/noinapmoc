The award remains valid for the entire product lifecycle.Featuring the next-generation AudioIQ2 digital signal processing (DSP) technology, the Plantronics Voyager PRO delivers superior noise and wind cancellation as well as rich, natural inbound audio so you can hear and be heard clearly in virtually any noisy environment--from windy sidewalks to hectic airports. This comfortable, behind-the-ear headset features two noise-canceling mics on a boom, AudioIQ2 technology with its adaptive 20-band equalizer, and three layers of WindSmart technology. The pivoting mic boom lets you wear the headset on either ear and optimize the position of the two microphones. An automatic voice prompt alerts you to battery and mute status. It provides up to six hours of continuous talk time and five days of standby from single charge.AudioIQ2 and WindSmart TechnologiesWhile other headsets deliver noise cancellation at the expense of overall audio quality, Voyager PRO's AudioIQ2 technology and unique adjustable dual-microphone boom provide the advantage of capturing your voice close to your mouth so the AudioIQ2 technology can more effectively remove ambient noise, while still maintaining the natural sound of your voice.With its finely tuned adaptive 20-band equalizer, AudioIQ2 makes you sound like you're in the same room as your caller, not miles apart. To achieve this, AudioIQ2 makes use of two microphones--one that's focused on your speech and the other that picks out distracting background sounds, such as road hum and construction noise. It then compares the data from the two mics and eliminates the unwanted sounds, leaving your unique voice free to be heard clearly and naturally, as it was meant to be.The dual microphones are also stacked with three layers of WindSmart technology. Stainless steel mic screens, acoustic fabrics, and an electronic filter in the mic circuitry--all aggressively block intrusive wind noise. The adjustable boom, which allows you to wear the headset on either ear, positions the mics where they can best capture your voice, further enhancing the sound quality.See aschematic of the Voyager PRO's controls.The Voyager PRO features a soft silicone ear tip that's ideal for acoustics and an ergonomic fit; a durable, flexible rubber that's suitable for continuous skin contact; and even weight distribution across multiple touch points to help avoid fatigue.Engineered for Comfort and Your Mobile LifestyleThe Plantronics Voyager PRO endured 24 rounds of human factors testing to perfect the design for all-day wearing, comfort, and stability. The behind-the-ear wearing style is perfectly counterbalanced so weight is distributed evenly, rendering it virtually weightless when worn. The Voyager  PRO ear tip is made of soft silicone for an optimal fit and features a \"sound channel\" that helps distribute audio evenly to the ear.Designed with the mobile professional-user in mind, it includes easily accessible power, volume and mute buttons and features voice prompts for low battery warnings and mute status. Finally, the lithium polymer battery provides up to six hours of continuous talk time and five days of stand-by time, exceeding the talk and standby times of most mobile phones.SpecificationsBluetooth technology: Version 2.1+EDR (Enhanced Data Rate)Bluetooth profiles: Hands-free v1.5 (HFP), Headset v1.1 (HSP)Range: Up to 33 feet (10 meters)QuickPair technology: Supports initial pairing with Bluetooth phonesMultipoint technology: Supports an active connection with two Bluetooth devicesHeadset controls: Power on/off; volume up/down; call answer/end; mute function; quick battery check; call reject; last number redial*; voice-activated dialing* (*if supported by phone and phone provider)Voice prompts: Mute status on/off; battery status for low/recharge batteryBattery type: 3.5V Li-ion polymer rechargeableCharge connectors: Micro USB connector and AC/DC 100&acirc;&euro;\"240VCharge time: 1.5 hours for full chargeWeight: 17.5 grams (0.62 ounces)Talk time: Up to 6 hoursStandby time: Up to 120 hours (5 days)Warranty: 1 year limited warrantyWhat's in the BoxVoyager PRO Bluetooth headset, AC wall/travel charger, three soft gel eartips, two foam eartip covers, and a printed user manual"}
