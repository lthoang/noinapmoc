Dashboard and windshield mounts are ideal for use with GPS applications as they position your phone up high in the vehicle. The mini friction dashboard mount is suitable for deep, slightly slanted or flat dashboards. Dashboard mounting is preferred in Minnesota and California where the use of windshield mounts is restricted. Most other friction dashboard mounts solely rely on the weight of the mount to secure it to the vehicle. Arkon's friction dashboard mount includes an adhesive safety anchor for added stability. The windshield mount included can also be used as a stand alone mount option. Included is Arkon's NEW Slim-Grip holder, ideal for use with ALL versions of the iPhone including the new iPhone 4, regardless of whether a protective skin or sleeve is used on the phone. Slim-Grip is the stylish, affordable, highly functional, quality iPhone holder that you've been waiting for. It features laterally adjustable support legs and a strong spring-loaded mechanism which securely grips your phone."}
