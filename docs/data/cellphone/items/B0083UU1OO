The OR3 can stream wireless music from up 40ft away when unobstructed! Take it wherever you go and blow away the other excuses for portable audio. No need to get your phone out of your pocket either - with built-in music controls you can adjust volume/playback and even take phone calls from the speaker itself.Portable meets PowerfulThis is NOT a mini speaker... Size matters, so we have packed this oversized softball shape speaker with a 2.75 inch full-range driver to provide clean audio reproduction. The focused 5W driver is how the OR3 achieves high volumes even with a portable design. The ported rear housing allows the bass to resonate, so in other words you don't miss a drum beat or bass line.Party All Night LongDon't stop the dancing to recharge! This speaker will last long after your party has ended. The extended-capacity battery can keep your music going for up to 32 hours of continuous use at mid-level volume and 16 hours on maximum volume! With an industry leading 3-Year Manufacturer's Warranty, you can be sure the OR3 will be the voice of your parties for years to come.WORKS WITH:Smartphones:Samsung Galaxy S5 , Galaxy K Zoom , S4 , Note 3 / Apple iPhone 5 , 5S , 5C / HTC One M8 , One Max / Motorola Moto E , Droid Moto X , G / LG G3 , G Flex , G Pro 2 / Sony Zperia Z2 , M2 / Nokia 220 , X , X+ , XLTablets:Acer Iconia / Apple iPad / Asus Vivotab / Dell Venue / Google Nexus 7 / LG G Pad / Microsoft Surface / Samsung Galaxy Note / Sony XperiaMP3:Apple iPod / SanDisk Sansa / Samsung Galaxy Player / Sony Walkman / Zune HD / Beats Music / PONO", "title": "GOgroove Portable BlueSYNC OR3 Bluetooth Speaker with Powerful 5W Driver and upto 32 Hour Rechargeable Battery - Works With Apple iPhone 5 , Samsung S5 , HTC M8 and More Smartphones", "price": 19.99, "salesRank": {"Cell Phones & Accessories": 1496}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511YS3hyhqL._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00FLL2ZTW", "B00B3YTQXY", "B00IN2S072", "B00J3FJEKK", "B005OLJEZC", "B00KL806PK", "B0038W0K34", "B00HFDOJGQ", "B008J2IQ3Y", "B00IGUUYTI", "B00J3N7FRQ", "B001N791HC", "B0069VH5QG", "B004H3XPQW", "B00DC9TN72", "B0056TYUD8", "B00E9OOUUE", "B004Q0E5HE", "B00GSNNWDA", "B00JX4USZ6", "B00CO2PETE", "B000WDW5HQ", "B00J05XK8A", "B0087UPRMQ", "B005VEZ4KQ", "B005MR57R2", "B0081ER9KG", "B00F0W1RIW", "B00GD8OKY0", "B00D5T3QK4", "B00HLHHBHA", "B004FRXKEW", "B00FRZSBQI", "B00E447L8C", "B00009YFTI", "B0033GLYQM", "B003NS5NK8", "1118531647", "B00G0X49VW", "B00FRMAOIO", "B00EDPW2Q8", "B000VTOG78", "B00GJFZSJS", "B000MANVWW", "B00DR0PDNE", "B00AVLOHJ8", "B00FCISG6K", "B00000JRRD", "B001RLYOEE"], "bought_together": ["B00B3YTQXY"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00B3YTQXY", "B008JGR9MO", "B00F5NE2KG", "B00FLL2ZTW"]}}
