When closed, the S-View cover offers instant access to critical features by easily swiping between menus with your finger or via the Galaxy Note S Pen. View the home screen to check the time and your phone\"s status. Accept or reject incoming calls with just a swipe. If you miss anything, notifications are shown in the recent activity menu of your S-View cover. Another menu allows you to quickly access your phone\"s camera, open the Action Memo menu or navigate your music tracks all without opening the cover. The built-in color system adds additional customization options, allowing you to select the color of the view window screen for a unique look. The back easily snaps on, replacing the phone\"s standard battery cover, without making the phone bulky. Additionally, this cover also enables wireless charging for your Galaxy Note 3. Once installed, you can place your phone on a Qi-compatible charging pad to charge your phone without having to plug/unplug charging cables."}
