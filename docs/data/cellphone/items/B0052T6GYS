Attempting to use a touchscreen device when you're wearing gloves is a little like trying to cross-stitch while wearing oven gloves, i.e. almost impossible. In the past you had to choose between frozen fingers and a workable device or cosy mitts and an unworkable gizmo... but not anymore! Thanks to the development of the iTouch gloves, you can keep warm while scrolling through your emails, sending a text, beating your high score on Bejeweled and generally maxing out on touchscreen goodness in the open air! iTouch gloves are super soft and work with most touchscreen devices, including the iPhone and the iPad. And you can rest assured they won't damage your prize gadgets; the special material woven into the fingertips is designed to be conductive without scratching or damaging your touchscreen in any way."}
