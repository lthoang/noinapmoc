Experience the innovative features. With new ways to share stories and discover music; camera enhancements for more creative photos; TecTile technology that adds a new level of functionality; and much moreShare Back-to-BackIf sharing is your thing, the Samsung Galaxy S III is your phone. With S Beam, you can share large HD files in seconds - just touch compatible devices back-to-back. S Beam takes full advantage of NFC (Near-Field Communication) and Wi-Fi Direct technology, making it quick and easy for you to share photos, videos, documents, calendars, contacts and more. And you don't even need Wi-Fi or a cellular signal.Share BigAs much as you like a crowd huddled around admiring your new phone, it won't be necessary with AllShare Play. Because now, you can play your music, videos and slide shows on any compatible HDTV or computer for all to see. Go big.Share Photos InstantlyShare Shot lets you share your photos with up to five friends - as you take them. What does this mean? You don't have to remember to share later; just share on the spot and forget it. Sharing has never been so much fun, so fast or so hassle-free.Gesture SmarterThe Galaxy S III goes beyond swiping and pinching. Special motion gestures let you do things easier and more intuitively than ever before. For example, to capture a screen shot, just swipe your hand across the screen. To get to the top of a list, just tap the top of your phone. Or if you're texting someone and want to call them, just put the phone to your ear. It doesn't get any smarter than that."}
