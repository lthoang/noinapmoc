Unlike conventional Bluetooth headphones and earbuds that use the eardrums to transmit sound, Aftershokz Bluez headphones utilize patent pending bone conduction technology to deliver sound through the listener's cheekbones to the inner ear. This enables anyone using them to make/take phone calls and stay connected to both what they are listening to and the outside world - from warning sounds outdoors while walking or driving to a nearby colleague in an office setting.  AfterShokz Bluez is the only Bluetooth headset that blends stereo sound with situational awareness - enabling hands free driving, and the ability to hear those around you in a business or commuter environment.  Bluez is also a great solution for those with special needs -- vision impaired individuals can use their phone without cutting off the rest of the world."}
