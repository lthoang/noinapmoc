The universal  design of the Mega Grip Holder accommodates any smartphone having up to  3.25&rdquo; width with no height restrictions, making it compatible even when  used with a large protective case or skin. This mount package includes  Arkon&rsquo;s Mega Grip one touch push-button holder and 18&rdquo; flexible aluminum  gooseneck floor mount. The holder&rsquo;s unique side-grip technology  provides a strong grip that&rsquo;s easy to use. Just set your phone in the  mount and close the arms to lock in place. A push of the holder&rsquo;s side  button releases the phone. The car seat floor mount is made of strong,  yet flexible aluminum. Install the mount to the car&rsquo;s seat rail with a  socket wrench by loosening the passenger seat track bolt, inserting the  seat track bolt bracket, and retightening the seat track bolt. Bend the  18&rdquo; gooseneck and rotate the swivel ball adapter head for 360&deg; rotation,  giving you the ultimate flexibility in viewing the smartphone or tablet  from any angle. If using a large, ruggedized case with the Samsung  Galaxy Mega, Galaxy Note 3, or Galaxy Note 2, Arkon recommends the new  Slim-Grip Ultra Model SM688 (also available on Amazon)."}
