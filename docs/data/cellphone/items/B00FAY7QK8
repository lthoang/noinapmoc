The case is easy to use: a plastic internal holder in its body allows the Samsung Galaxy S4 to be held securely in place at all times, providing increased stability during operation. Unlike many cases and covers, which can add excess weight, the Samsung Galaxy S4 case is made to be as lightweight and unobtrusive as possible, ensuring that the user experience is as comfortable and as streamlined as it can be. The Samsung Galaxy S4 case has a number of convenient cut-out ports in the back of its frame, enabling constant access to the 13 Megapixel camera of the Galaxy SIV. As a soft case, though, one of the chief utility features of the Samsung Galaxy S4 case is the side grip packaged into its frame, which enable you to keep your phone securely protected as your Smartphone moves in your hand", "title": "Galaxy S4 Case, Galaxy s4 cases- S4 Case Compatible With Samsung Galaxy S4 SIV S IV i9500 s4 case- Soft Jelly Case Shell Cover Skin Cases By Cable and Case - Blue Galaxy S4 Case", "price": 6.99, "salesRank": {"Cell Phones & Accessories": 4172}, "imUrl": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Px0t50EsL._SY300_.jpg", "related": {"also_bought": ["B00C5SMPA8", "B00DNXA2M2", "B00E5CN4GG", "B00BT7RCEK", "B00E8ODMKO", "B00A8XD8XU", "B00BUDL3B6", "B00BMIG4CC", "B00BSXXOC4", "B00CK8XOAI", "B00A8S5KIG", "B00FKIW1KE", "B002LTG5X4", "B00CV2M69S", "B00DM89DGY", "B00ENCBSKW", "B00BT7RAPG", "B00CHL93NA", "B00BUDLBK4", "B00BOHOGMG", "B00BW0XZOU", "B00DZVCZAY", "B00CK0NC9E", "B00GJ7XA5K", "B00CGRS4KI", "B00EMY2968", "B00F0D67Z4", "B00CRNTDII", "B00FPJ6GOK", "B00BZ03J98", "B00BQ3FZ9G", "B00DLKGNSE", "B00BUIG6E0", "B00BYG38JO", "B00BSGGQCQ", "B00BUFZIE2", "B00BXDP8AU", "B00BUE8Q2O", "B00FB75MX2", "B00BW0Y17A", "B00BW0X892", "B00E0TD5SQ", "B00CMRKVAI", "B00C30XCH8", "B000SV5HGS", "B00CC2K0FO", "B00GBQ4MFG", "B00CTUAR6Q", "B00EP6KHVW", "B00CDB66AW", "B00CL83R1S", "B00HWEJJSQ", "B00CLUZ8OU", "B00CI8PTNA", "B00BW6GK50", "B00DM89AWG", "B00HHQVA2W", "B00FXGBTCE", "B00CV2M6CK", "B00BW6GH76", "B00DUR2GZM", "B00DD2J1DY", "B00GBQ4MFQ", "B00CV2M68E", "B00EMY297M", "B00BUIG73U", "B00CV2M6MA", "B00G70FVG0", "B00EO984NI", "B00DUFFPAW", "B00C9TM8WI", "B00DPIKE3M", "B00CXADUE8", "B00DPNAY1E", "B00D7MOHDO", "B00BBD0A82", "B00GP0GUC6", "B00CSM6H78", "B00GJLJ9P6", "B00DUGJONA", "B00CV2M69I", "B00CC2K0TA", "B00COT161M", "B00DHADQOW", "B00D8QXBWM", "B00C4VRYM0", "B00E4B82RE", "B00CA6BJ0C", "B00KGUZ0ZO"], "bought_together": ["B00C5SMPA8"], "buy_after_viewing": ["B00C5SMPA8", "B00BT7RCEK", "B00A8XD8XU"]}}
