The Jawbone PRIME can handle wind up to 10 mph, enabling you to have intelligible conversations while maintaining the natural sound of the your voice.The Jawbone PRIME in black.The PRIME headset features a unique undulating texture, crafted with high precision in 3-D to reflect the light and give a sense of movement to the exterior surfaces. The design has also been enhanced by a slight indication in the shield's texture, a small tactile crease that indicates where the switch is located. The inside contour of the PRIME follows the curve of your face comfortably. And with three round Earbuds, three New Fit Earbuds and an optional earloop, you can choose what works best for your individual ear.The Voice Activity Sensor (VAS) on the interior curve of the Jawbone PRIME.The Jawbone PRIME includes Multipoint functionality and can be simultaneously connected to two Bluetooth enabled devices. To charge the PRIME's internal battery, you can use the included AC wall charger, or plug the USB cable into your computer (full charge takes approximately 50 minutes).The Science Behind Jawbone PRIMEOriginally developed for use in tanks and helicopters, Jawbone PRIME's NoiseAssassin is a proprietary technology that eliminates background noise from mobile phone conversations. Jawbone is the only Bluetooth headset with a Voice Activity Sensor (VAS) that actually feels your speech, which helps Jawbone distinguish your voice from background noise. The NoiseAssassin 2.0 technology embedded in the PRIME delivers an order of magnitude improvement in the noisiest environments (6 to 9dB) extracting even more noise while keeping the user's voice natural.The Acoustic Voice Activity Detector (AVAD) provides a fail-safe mechanism when the Voice Activity Sensor (VAS) doesn't touch your face. When the VAS is not touching the face, Jawbone PRIME performs as good as or better than any other noise-cancelling headset. When the VAS touches the face, you get the turbo-boost to the NoiseAssassin performance.SpecificationsBluetooth V2.1 compliantSupports Enhanced Data Rate (EDR)Up to 4.5 hours talk timeUp to 9 days standby timeSupports Multipoint for two audio gateways including PCRange up to 33 feet (10 meters)Weight: 0.4 ounces (11 grams)What's in the BoxJawbone PRIME headset, three round earbuds, three Fit earbuds, one earloop, USB cable, AC wall adapter."}
